The purpose of the Linux Security Assessment is to provide feedback and recommen-
dations on improving your Linux security process. Feedback and recommendations
were primarily derived from analyzing the security implementation of one of your
operational Linux installations.

Note that the partition is not an isolated system, but typically exists within a net-
working infrastructure. Many of the risks from external users are tempered by the
networking security infrastructure that it resides in. However, our focus is on the
host-based mechanisms used to secure the partition itself and not on elements found
outside the host that could affect the host’s security.
