<section><title>Introduction and Scope</title>
<para>
The purpose of the
<citetitle pubwork="article">Linux Security Assessment</citetitle>
is to provide feedback and recommendations on improving your Linux security process.
Feedback and recommendations were primarily derived from analyzing the security
implementation of one of your operational Linux installations.
</para>
<para>The purpose of this report is to analyze the target host and
suggest a set of best practice requirements.
The LinuxSA application makes no attempt to implement a security policy. It is up
to the system administrator to interpret this report and make the necessary
adjustments to the host in order to implement the applicable security policy.
That policy may or may not agree with the best practice requirement suggested in
this report.
</para>
<para>
Note that the host is not an isolated system, but typically exists within a
networking infrastructure. Many of the risks from external users are tempered by the
networking security infrastructure in which it resides. However, our focus is on the
host-based mechanisms used to secure the host itself and not on elements found
outside the host that could affect the host's security.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Linux Assessment Details</title>
<para>
The following assessment systematically approaches assessing security on an
Linux host. Currently this assessment is only valid for Linux distributions which
adhere to the <emphasis role="bold">Linux Standards Base</emphasis> and the
<emphasis role="bold">Linux Filesystem Standard</emphasis>.
