               Installation Notes for LinuxSA
               ==============================

There are 2 basic ways to install LinuxSA.  From simplest to most complex
they are:

* Download either the tar.gz or the zip package from SourceForge (the
contents of both packages are the same).

* Checkout the source from the the ooRexx Subversion repository.

Please read ALL of these notes before attempting to build ooRexx.

Install Using the Downloaded Package
====================================

The tar.gz and zip packages have exactly the same content. However, the
files in the tar.gz file are in Unix format (LF separators) and the zip file
uses the DOS format (CRLF separators). This is the only difference.

Once you have the package, unpack it in the location of your choice. You are
now ready to use the package. See the README.txt file for usage instructions.


Checkout and Install from the Subversion Repository
===================================================

The entire source tree for LinuxSA is available for anyone and can be checked
out using a Subversion client and anonymous access.  Apart from the client,
the procedure is the same on all platforms.  Subversion clients and / or
instructions for installing Subversion clients for most platforms are
available at:

  http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html

Once the Subversion client is installed, the command to checkout is as
follows, using the 1.0 head as an example:

E:\work>svn co https://oorexx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/oorexx/linuxsa/trunk linuxsa

You can also check out the release code for any version of ooRexx.  Using
the 1.0.0 release as an example, use the proper release number for other
versions:

E:\work>svn co https://oorexx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/oorexx/linuxsa/releases/1.0.0 linuxsa

In this command, the last word of the command is the directory into which
the source tree will be checked out.  The name of the directory can be any
name that is desired, 'linuxsa' might be a common choice.

Again, note that the svn command is the same on any platform.  The example
happens to be from a Windows system, the svn command is the same on Linux.
