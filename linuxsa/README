The Linux Security Assessment (LinuxSA) tool provides an automated method of assessing
the security settings of a Linux distributions. It has been tested on the following
distributions.

Red Hat 6 and 7
CentOS 7
Fedora 21
openSUSE 13.2
SLES and SLED 12

LinuxSA uses the "Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5"
published by the National Security Agency (NSA) as the specification for the assessment.
This document is freely available from the US Government at
https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/NSA_RHEL_5_GUIDE_v4.2.pdf
The LinuxSA assessment tool is organized to reflect this document so finding a specific
assessment activity is as easy as possible.

Altouugh the NSA document has not been updated for later versions of Red Hat, LinuxSA
has updated the assessment mechanisms to reflect RHEL 6 and 7 as well as Fedora, SuSE,
Ubuntu, and OpenSuSE. All efforts will be made to continue updating LinuxSA to support
newer operating system releases.


Requirements
============

1. This tools is meant to be run from your laptop or workstation.
2. Open Object Rexx (ooRexx) 4.0 or later is required. You can obtain ooRexx at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx/files/?source=navbar
3. Debian based systems (Ubuntu, Mint, etc) are not supported by LinuxSA.
4. The target Linux distribution must be configured as follows:
   a. The remote target machine must have at least one network interface that allows a
      standard user to login via ssh.
   b. In order to eliminate the prompts for the user's password you should utilize your
      ssh public key and install it into the machine containing LinuxSA.
   c. For Windows you should install the latest version of Putty to provide SSH.
5 The Publican document system is required to build the output report. You will need to
  install the Publican RPM or the Publican-Installer-xxx.exe for Windows. There is also
  a version for Mac OSX (see the Publican Users's Guide).

Notes
=====

1. Before creating the report you should copy the files from the report_skel subdirectory to
   the report subdirectory.
2. Edit the report/en-US/report.xml file and apply the customer name and the current date
   to the file.
3. After running the linuxsa.rex script you should review the output and make any
   changes/additions necessary to the report/summary.xml file. There are any number of
   items you may want to note concerning both specific and general security settings of
   the customer's target environment. After you make your additions you can rebuild the report.
4. The buildrpt script will build the the report only on a Linux machine. You will need to
   manually run the necessary commands on Windows.
