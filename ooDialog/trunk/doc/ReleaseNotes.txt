                 Release Notes ooDialog 4.2.1 (preview)
                 ======================================

NOTE: This preview version is a SNAPSHOT of the current development in
      ooDialog.  It is not a beta release, or even an alpha release.
      The build is placed here to allow to interested parties to toy
      with some of the new features coming up.  Devlopment work is still
      on-going and new interfaces are not guarenteed.  Method names and
      or method arguments of features currently in development may
      change before a final release.

The ooDialog 4.2.1 release is focused on improvements to the ListView
class in ooDialog.  In addition to bug fixes, this release contains a
number of enhancement to the list-view implementation in ooDialog.

ooDialog 4.2.1 can be installed to any ooRexx installation, 4.1.0 or
later.

Beginning with the release of ooDialog 4.2.0, the installation of
ooDialog has been decoupled from the interpreter.  ooDialog 4.2.1
installs over the top of any ooRexx installation.  It replaces the
version of ooDialog in the ooRexx installation with ooDialog 4.2.1.

This type of ooDialog installation is called an "independent" ooDialog
installation to indicate the ooDialog installation is independent of an
ooRexx installation and, to a degree, the version of ooRexx installed.

ooDialog 4.2.1 requires a minimum ooRexx version of 4.1.0.


Installation
========================================================================

Installation is simple, done through a typical Windows installer.  Pick
the installation package that matches the bitness of the ooRexx
installation.  I.e., a 32-bit package for a 32-bit ooRexx and a 64-bit
package for a 64-bit ooRexx.

The installer will detect the installed ooRexx, location and version.
If the ooRexx version is less than 4.1.0, or if there is no installed
ooRexx, the installer will abort with a message explaining the problem.
Otherwise the installer will replace the current ooDialog with ooDialog
4.2.1.

Note that the actions of the installer are dependent on the version of
ooRexx, not the version of the installed ooDialog.  For instance, if the
installed ooDialog is version 4.3.0, but for some reason the user is not
happy with that version, running the ooDialog 4.2.1 installer will
replace the 4.3.0 version with the 4.2.1 version.

At the time of the installation, *all* ooDialog programs must be halted
and the ooDialog PDFs must be closed if they happen to be opened.

New Functionality in ooDialog:
------------------------------

An implementation that allows acces to the Custom Draw facility in
Microsoft's Common Control library has been added.

Custom Draw allows, for example, the programmer to specify the text and
background colors for individual rows in a ListView, even for individual
columns in the row.  The programmer can specify the font of the text for
individual list-view items.  Etc., etc..

The CustomDraw class has been added to ooDialog and is the means to
access the Custom Draw facilities.

New ListView support classes:
-----------------------------

LvItem class:

Represents a single list-view item.  The attributes of the LvItem are
the attributes of the underlying Windows list-view item.

LvSubItem class:

Represents a single list-view subitem.  The attributes of the LvSubItem
are the attributes of the underlying Windows list-view subitem.

LvFullRow class:

List-view items can contain subitems.  This is most apparent in the row
view of a list-vies where the subitems are displayed in columns next to
the item.  However, the subitems, once added to an item,  are always
present, even if the list-view is in another view, such as icon view.

The LvFullRow class represents the list-view item and all its subitems.
LvFullRow objects can be used to insert an item and all data associated
with the item into a list-view at one time.

LvCustomDrawSimple class:

The LvCustomDrawSimple class is used in conjuction with the custom draw
facility for ListView controls.

New ListView methods:
---------------------

addFullRow()
insertFullRow()
prependFullRow()

New dialog classes:
-------------------

CustomDraw class:

The CustomDraw class is a new mixin class.  Dialogs in ooDialog can
inherit this class, which then gives the dialog the ability to access
the custom draw facility.

The ListView and TreeView controls can register for custom draw.


New utility classes:
--------------------

TvCustomDrawSimple class:

The TvCustomDrawSimple class is used in conjuction with the custom draw
facility for TreeView controls.


New Methods:
------------

In the DialogControl class:

useVersion()
usingVersion()

In the TreeView class:

find()
getItemData()
itemText()
removeItemData()
setItemData()


Enhanced Methods:
-----------------

In the DialogControl class:

setColor()
setSysColor()

In the DialogExtensions class:

setControlColor()
setControlSysColor()

In the TreeView class:

insert()
itemInfo()
modify()

In the EventNotification class:

connectListViewItem()

  * the KEYDOWNEX event is added.

connectTreeViewItem()

  * the KEYDOWNEX event is added.


New samples:
------------

oodialog\controls\customDrawListView.rex

The customDrawListView example demonstrates how to change the text, text
color, and background color of individual rows in a list-view.

Enhanced samples:
-----------------

oodialog\treeViewCustomDraw.rex

The oodtree.rex example has been renamed to the treeViewCustomDraw.rex
and enhanced.  The example has been more fully commented, uses custom
draw for the tree-view control, and has a number of small bugs fixed.


Documentation
-------------

The ListView Control chapter in the ooDialog Reference Manual has been
reviewed and corrected for accuracy.  The entire chapter has been
updated to match the format and style that was introduced in the rework
of the manual done for ooDialog 4.2.0


Known Problems, "Gotchas," and Solutions with Independent Installations
========================================================================

* Problem:

The ooRexx installer creates a log of the files it installs.  When the
uninstaller runs, the user can select to only uninstall files logged
during installtion.  An indpendent ooDialog installation may install
some example programs, documentation files, and shortcuts not recorded
in the log file.  When ooRexx is uninstalled or upgraded, these files
and shortcuts may not be deleted.

  Solution 1:

  Before uninstalling ooRexx, install the independent ooDialog that
  matches the ooRexx installation.  I.e., if the ooRexx installation is
  any 4.0.x, or 4.1.x ooRexx version, install the ooDialog 4.1.0
  indpendent installation. Then when ooRexx is uninstalled, all ooDialog
  files and shortcuts will be removed because the files and shortcuts
  exactly match what was installed during the ooRexx installation.

  Solution 2:

  After uninstalling ooRexx, manually delete any files in the old ooRexx
  installation directory.

* Gotcha:

  The independent ooDialog installation deletes the entire ooDialog
  samples subdirectory tree.  This will delete any personal files
  that may have been put there after ooRexx was installed.

  Solution 1:

  Do not put personal files in the %REXX_HOME%\samples\ooDialog
  subdirectory tree.

  Solution 2:

  Before executing the independent ooDialog installer, move or back up
  any personal files that may be in %REXX_HOME%\samples\ooDialog
  subdirectory tree.
