                    Release Notes ooDialog 4.2.0 Beta 1
                    ===================================

ooDialog 4.2.0 is the first major enhancement in ooDialog in over a
decade.  There are many improvements and enhancements, more than can be
listed explicitly.  The "New in ooDialog 4.2.0" section below gives an
outline of the changes.  To fully understand the changes refer to the
ooDialog reference manual.

ooDialog 4.2.0 can be installed to any ooRexx installation, 4.1.0 or
later.

Beginning with the release of ooDialog 4.2.0, the installation of
ooDialog has been decoupled from the interpreter.  ooDialog 4.2.0
installs over the top of any ooRexx installation.  It replaces the
version of ooDialog in the ooRexx installation with ooDialog 4.2.0.

This type of ooDialog installation is called an "independent" ooDialog
installation to indicate the ooDialog installation is independent of an
ooRexx installation and, to a degree, the version of ooRexx installed.

This installation can be done today.  The next major release of ooRexx
will include ooDialog 4.2.0, but there is no reason to wait for that
release.  Going forward, ooDialog users will be able to install any
version of ooDialog they want to their ooRexx installation.  Provided of
course that the ooRexx version meets the minimum required version for
the ooDialog version.

ooDialog 4.2.0 requires a minimum ooRexx version of 4.1.0.


Installation
============

Installation is simple, done through a typical Windows installer.  Pick
the installation package that matches the bitness of the ooRexx
installation.  I.e., a 32-bit package for a 32-bit ooRexx and a 64-bit
package for a 64-bit ooRexx.

The installer will detect the installed ooRexx, location and version.
If the ooRexx version is less than 4.1.0, or if there is no installed
ooRexx, the installer will abort with a message explaining the problem.
Otherwise the installer will replace the current ooDialog with ooDialog
4.2.0.

Note that the actions of the installer are dependent on the version
of ooRexx, not the version of the installed ooDialog.  For instance, if
the installed ooDialog is version 4.3.0, but for some reason the user is
not happy with that version, running the ooDialog 4.2.0 installer will
replace the 4.3.0 version with the 4.2.0 version.

At the time of the installation, *all* ooDialog programs must be halted
and the ooDialog PDFs must be closed if they happen to be opened.

An alternative way to install ooDialog 4.2.0 is to install
switchOODialog.


switchOODialog
==============

Switch ooDialog provided a way for users of ooDialog to begin testing
and experimenting with the new features in 4.2.0.  This technology will
be continued so that users can upgrade their version of ooDialog without
worrying about the consequences.  If there is some problem and they are
not happy with ooDialog 4.2.0, they can easily switch back to ooDialog
4.1.0

Switch ooDialog makes it possible for users to easily and transparently
switch back and forth between ooDialog 4.2.0 and the release version of
ooDialog packaged with ooRexx 4.1.0.  Switch ooDialog is downloadable
from SourceForge making an upgrade to ooDialog 4.2.0 worry free.

To install ooDialog 4.2.0, pick the switchOODialog package that matches
the bitness of the installed ooRexx.

When switchOODialog is initially installed, the active version of
ooDialog will be ooDialog 4.2.0.  switchOODialog.exe acts like a toggle.
It time it is executed it switches the active version of ooDialog
between 4.1.0 and 4.2.0.

switchOODialog can be executed from the command line, or through menu
items in the ooRexx section of the Start menu.

switchOODialog has the same requirements as does a regular installation
of ooDialog 4.2.0.  There must be an installed version of ooRexx that is
at least version 4.1.0.  At the time of the installation, *all* ooDialog
programs must be halted and the ooDialog PDFs must be closed if they
happen to be opened.


Known Problems, "Gotchas," and Solutions with Independent Installations
=======================================================================

* Problem:

  The ooRexx installer creates a log of the files it installs.  When the
  uninstaller runs, the user can select to only uninstall files logged
  during installtion.  An indpendent ooDialog installation may install
  some example programs, documentation files, and shortcuts not recorded
  in the log file.  If at the point, ooRexx is uninstalled, these files
  and shortcuts may not be deleted.

  Solution 1:

  Before uninstalling ooRexx, install the independent ooDialog that
  matches the ooRexx installation.  I.e., if the ooRexx installation is
  any 4.0.x, or 4.1.x ooRexx version, install the ooDialog 4.1.0
  indpendent installation. Then when ooRexx is uninstalled, all ooDialog
  files and shortcuts will be removed because the files and shortcuts
  exactly match what was installed during the ooRexx installation.

  Solution 2:

  After uninstalling ooRexx, manually delete any files in the old ooRexx
  installation directory.

* Gotcha:

  The independent ooDialog installation deletes the entire ooDialog
  samples subdirectory tree.  This will delete any personal files
  that may have been put there after ooRexx was installed.

  Solution 1:

  Do not put personal files in the %REXX_HOME%\samples\ooDialog
  subdirectory tree.

  Solution 2:

  Before executing the independent ooDialog installer, move or back up
  any personal files that may be in %REXX_HOME%\samples\ooDialog
  subdirectory tree.

New Methods:
------------

Many new methods have been added, too many to list individually.  Many
new methods have been added to the dialog object.  Most, if not all of
the dialog control classes have new methods.

New samples:
------------

Many new samples have been added to the distribution.  In addition, many
of the existing samples have been reworked to better demonstrate how
ooDialog works.

Documentation
-------------

Much of the ooDialog Method Reference book has been rewritten to correct
errors.  The format of some sections has been changed to make finding
the relevant information easier.  All method tables now give a short
description of the method within the table.

A new book, the ooDialog User Guide, has been added to the ooDialog
distribution.  The ooDialog User Guide includes a number of example
programs that go along with the text in the guide.  These examples are
include in the example program section of ooDialog.
