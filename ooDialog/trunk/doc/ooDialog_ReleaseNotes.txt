                      Release Notes ooDialog 4.2.4
                      ============================

The ooDialog 4.2.4 release is ?

ooDialog 4.2.4 can be installed to any ooRexx installation, 4.1.0 or
later.

Beginning with the release of ooDialog 4.2.0, the installation of
ooDialog has been decoupled from the interpreter.  ooDialog 4.2.4
installs over the top of any ooRexx installation.  It replaces the
version of ooDialog in the ooRexx installation with ooDialog 4.2.4.

This type of ooDialog installation is called an "independent" ooDialog
installation to indicate the ooDialog installation is independent of an
ooRexx installation and, to a degree, the version of ooRexx installed.

ooDialog 4.2.4 requires a minimum ooRexx version of 4.1.0.


Installation
========================================================================

Installation is simple, done through a typical Windows installer.  Pick
the installation package that matches the bitness of the ooRexx
installation.  I.e., a 32-bit package for a 32-bit ooRexx and a 64-bit
package for a 64-bit ooRexx.

The installer will detect the installed ooRexx, location and version.
If the ooRexx version is less than 4.1.0, or if there is no installed
ooRexx, the installer will abort with a message explaining the problem.
Otherwise the installer will replace the current ooDialog with ooDialog
4.2.3.

Note that the actions of the installer are dependent on the version of
ooRexx, not the version of the installed ooDialog.  For instance, if the
installed ooDialog is version 4.3.0, but for some reason the user is not
happy with that version, running the ooDialog 4.2.4 installer will
replace the 4.3.0 version with the 4.2.4 version.

At the time of the installation, *all* ooDialog programs must be halted
and the ooDialog PDFs must be closed if they happen to be opened.

Known Problems, "Gotchas," and Solutions with Independent Installations
========================================================================

* Problem:

The ooRexx installer creates a log of the files it installs.  When the
uninstaller runs, the user can select to only uninstall files logged
during installtion.  An indpendent ooDialog installation may install
some example programs, documentation files, and shortcuts not recorded
in the log file.  When ooRexx is uninstalled or upgraded, these files
and shortcuts may not be deleted.

  Solution 1:

  Before uninstalling ooRexx, install the independent ooDialog that
  matches the ooRexx installation.  I.e., if the ooRexx installation is
  any 4.0.x, or 4.1.x ooRexx version, install the ooDialog 4.1.0
  indpendent installation. Then when ooRexx is uninstalled, all ooDialog
  files and shortcuts will be removed because the files and shortcuts
  exactly match what was installed during the ooRexx installation.

  Solution 2:

  After uninstalling ooRexx, manually delete any files in the old ooRexx
  installation directory.

* Gotcha:

  The independent ooDialog installation deletes the entire ooDialog
  samples subdirectory tree.  This will delete any personal files
  that may have been put there after ooRexx was installed.

  Solution 1:

  Do not put personal files in the %REXX_HOME%\samples\ooDialog
  subdirectory tree.

  Solution 2:

  Before executing the independent ooDialog installer, move or back up
  any personal files that may be in %REXX_HOME%\samples\ooDialog
  subdirectory tree.
