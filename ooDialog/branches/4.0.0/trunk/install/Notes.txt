                     A few notes on ooDialog 4.0.0
                     =============================

ooDialog 4.0.0 is intended to be / to work the same as ooDialog 3.2.0.

1.) In the oostdfct.rex example, the CheckList example does not display,
properly.  However this is the same as it is under ooRexx 3.2.0, so it
is alright.
