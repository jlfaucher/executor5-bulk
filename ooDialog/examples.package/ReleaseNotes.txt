                          Extra ooDialog Samples
                          ======================

  The extra ooDialog samples package is meant to provide ooDialog
  programmers with example programs beyond what is shipped with the regular
  ooRexx installation.

  ooDialog users should request examples they would like to see, and are
  encouraged to submit their own example programs that they would like to
  share with other users.  It would be gratifying to the author if ooDialog
  users participated in shaping what example programs are included in the
  package.

  The example programs are installed through a normal Windows installer,
  which includes an uninstall program.  The package can be cleanly,
  completely, uninstalled using the Control Panel -> Add / Remove Programs.
  Alternatively, the package can be uninstalled by running the
  uninstaller.exe program in the installation directory.

  By default the package is installed in the current user's application data
  folder.  This location can be changed during installation.
