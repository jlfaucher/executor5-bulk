The EditControlEx example program demonstrates some of the newis edit
control features in ooDialog.

NOTE: This example program is a work in progress, but it may be useful to
      any one wishing to get a quick start guide to using the edit control
      features.

NOTE: The EditControlEx dialog was created with ResEdit.  You can use
      ResEdit or any other resource editor with the EditControl.rc to change
      the lay out of the dialog.
