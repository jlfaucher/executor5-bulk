                      Extra ooDialog Samples v0.0.6
                      =============================

  The extra ooDialog samples package is meant to provide ooDialog
  programmers with example programs beyond what is shipped with the
  regular ooRexx installation.

  Download the installation package that matches the bitness of you ooRexx
  installation.  If you have a 32-bit ooRexx installed use the package
  containing _x86_32 in its name.  If you have 64-bit ooRexx installed use
  the package with _x86_64 in its name.

  ooDialog users should request examples they would like to see, and are
  encouraged to submit their own example programs that they would like to
  share with other users.  It would be gratifying to the author if
  ooDialog users participated in shaping what example programs are
  included in the package.

  The example programs are installed through a normal Windows installer,
  which includes an uninstall program.  The package can be cleanly,
  completely, uninstalled using the Control Panel -> Add / Remove
  Programs.  Alternatively, the package can be uninstalled by running the
  uninstaller.exe program in the installation directory.

  By default the package is installed in the current user's application
  data folder.  This location can be changed during installation.

  To gain the full benefit of the examples, the comments throughout the
  program code should be read.  Some directories may contain additional
  documentation in the form of "read me" files within the directory.

  Notes:
  ------

  *  Version 0.0.6 of the package requires ooDialog 4.2.0 or later to run
  most of the example programs in the package.  Some example programs now
  require ooDialog 4.2.1.  This is in anticipation of an upcoming release
  for ooDialog.

  *  The release contains around 2 dozen example programs.

  --------

  *  Several of the new examples use resource-only DLLs.  Starting with
  this release a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the package is available.
  Pick the bitness of the package to match the bitness of your ooRexx.

  *  Several small examples were moved to their own directories.  Starting
  with this release all examples will be placed in their own direcotry.
  The name of the example listed here will be the name of the directory
  containing the example files.

  *  nMake compatible make files were add to the directories of examples
  that use resource-only DLLs to allow users to rebuild the DLLs if they
  choose to.

  *  The makeDll.rex program was added to the top-level directory.  This
  Rexx program can be used to build a resource-only DLL.  The file
  makeDLL.ReadMe contains some brief explanation on how to use the
  program.
