* In addition to this lengthy document, there is a bare bones procedure to
build ooRexx and package it.  It uses a script to automate the process,
and is documented in pkgDeb.quickstart.


1.)  Building and Packaging Open Object Rexx on a Debian system
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These notes are derived using Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (‘sarge’) and Kubuntu
6.10 which are the respective current, stable, releases for those two
distributions.

One of the primary purposes of this text is to document the process of
building an Open Object Rexx Debian package for the maintainers of Open
Object Rexx in its entirety.  As such, some of the sections may go
into more detail than an experienced user on a Debian system may need.

Instructions on installing Debian and managing packages on a Debian system
are beyond the scope of this document.  In addition, the author has limited
experience working on Debian Linux.  However, since additional packages
beyond the base Debian install are needed to build and package Open Object
Rexx, some documentation on how to upgrade a base installation with the
necessary packages is included.

Those familiar with Debian should skip over the next section, go straight
to the "3.) Necessary Packages ..." section, and use their preferred
method to ensure the system has the needed packages.


2.)  Installing Debian and Packages for the Debian Novice
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that this process is the process the author used, it is by no means
the only way, or even the best way, to install Debian.  It is provided to
document a workable process for the Open Object Rexx maintainers.

Installation:
-------------

* Debian Sarge:  Go to http://www.debian.org/

* Kubuntu:       Go to http://www.kubuntu.org/

* Follow the links to download ISO install images for the current stable
release.

* Download and burn the ISO image for CD number 1 only.  Kubuntu only has 1
install CD.  With Debian Sarge you can download ISO images for everything,
however installing completely from CD did not set up the online
repositories correctly.  (User error?) This made the attempt to add the
necessary packages difficult with limited knowledge of Debian.  Installing
the base from 1 CD and finishing the installation over the network was a
better way to go about things.

* Install.  The process is very similar to most Linux installations.

Debian Sarge: When the minimal installation is finished, select to finish
the base install over the network.  (Requires a working network connection
obviously.)

Kubuntu:  Installing from the 1 CD leaves the user with a fully functional
OS.

Updating Packages
-----------------

These instructions are based on a desire to use a KDE desktop and the
Synaptic package manager.

Debian
------
* After logging in to the initial system, go to console window and run
aptitude.  Select to install KDE, if not already installed.  In addition,
use the u option for update.  The combination of these two steps resulted
in the Synaptic package manager being installed on the system.  (There may
be a simpler way to do this.)

* Log into a KDE desktop.

* The Synaptic package manager can be found by going to the main menu,

  Debian -> Apps -> System -> Synaptic Package Manager

* Once Synaptic starts, use the search feature to find and mark for install
the necessary packages.

Kubuntu
-------

* Log on after the initial install.  From the KMenu select: Add / Remove
Programs.  This starts the Adept Installer.  Use the 'Search' feature and
search for Synaptic.  Select to install that package.

* Start Synaptic.  Once Synaptic is installed, it can be started through
the K Menu, under the System section.

* Push the "Reload" button in the upper left corner of the Synaptic window.
This refreshes the 'repositories' list.

* Push the "Mark All Upgrades" button and then the "Apply" button.  This
will bring the system up to date.


3.)  Necessary Packages to Build and Package Open Object Rexx
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debian:

This list comprises the extra packages installed after finishing a basic or
standard install.  Note that this is what is needed to do everything
completely from scratch.  (This version of xalan does not work,
touchheaders.sh was used.)

autoconf 2.59a-3
automake 1.9.5-1
build-essential 10.1
debhelper 4.2.32
dh-make 0.38
fakeroot 1.2.10
libtool 1.5.6-6
subversion 1.1.4-2
xalan 1.8-4

Not necessary, but also added:

unzip 5.52-1sarge4
zip 2.31-1

Kubuntu:

autoconf (versions to be added)
automake
build-essential
debhelper
dh-make
fakeroot
libtool
subversion
xalan

Not necessary, but also added:

unzip
zip
