Development Snapshot Builds

This area of the repository allows developers to share builds for testing and review.

These builds are not release ready and should only be used for testing and never in release environments.

If you are a developer leaving a build, please leave it in a folder named for the commit you built against.

ie: code-0\development-Snapshot-builds\interpreter\ubuntu\10933\...

please remove obsoleted builds when you add new ones
