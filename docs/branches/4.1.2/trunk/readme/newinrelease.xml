<section><title>New in this Release</title>
<para>
  This section lists the new features and enhancements introduced since Open Object Rexx 4.1.1. However, Open Object
  Rexx 4.1.2 is a bug fix only release and there are no new features or enhancements. This section of the document is
  left as a template for future releases.
</para>
<para>
  You should refer to the CHANGES document accompanying the release for a complete list of the bug fixes.  In addition,
  there is a ReleaseNotes document that contains essentially the same information as this section, but in a text format.
  These documents are accessible the SourceForge download page for each ooRexx release. They are also included in the
  source code for ooRexx when SourceForge is not used.
