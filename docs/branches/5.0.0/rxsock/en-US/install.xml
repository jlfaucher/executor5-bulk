<para>The RxSock package is contained in the file rxsock.dll. This file must be placed in
a directory listed in your LIBPATH. To get access to the functions in the RxSock
package, execute the following Rexx code:
<programlisting>
If RxFuncQuery("SockDropFuncs") then
do
   rc = RxFuncAdd("SockLoadFuncs","rxsock","SockLoadFuncs")
   rc = SockLoadFuncs()
end
</programlisting></para>

<para>To unload the DLL, call the SockDropFuncs() function and then exit all CMD.EXE
shells. After exiting all command shells, the DLL is dropped by the system and can
be deleted or replaced.</para>
