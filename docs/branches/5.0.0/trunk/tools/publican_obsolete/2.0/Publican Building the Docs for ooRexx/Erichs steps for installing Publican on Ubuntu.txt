 I tried this some two or three years ago, and it was a miserable experience.
 I've attached below my notes from back then.
 
 If you want to give it a try, please note down each step as accurately
 as possible.  If we get somewhere, I'll add the steps required to our Wiki.
 
 I tried getting help for a few things by posting to the publican-list publican-list@...
 
 The publican-list archives are to be found at https://www.redhat.com/archives/publican-list/

1. sudo apt install publican
 # this will install fop, but fop is deprecated by publican, it wants wkhtmltopdf

 # installing wkhtmltopdf doesn't seem to work, as publican requires a 'patched' version
 # see https://www.redhat.com/archives/publican-list/2014-April/msg00003.html
 
 # in case we've already tried to install wkhtmltopdf:
 # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18758589/wkhtmltopdf-installation-error-on-ubuntu
2. sudo apt-get remove --purge wkhtmltopdf
 
 # now let's install 'patched' wkhtmltopdf:
3. sudo apt-get install openssl build-essential xorg libssl-dev
 # http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html

4. wget http://download.gna.org/wkhtmltopdf/0.12/0.12.3/wkhtmltox-0.12.3_linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz

5. tar xf wkhtmltox-0.12.3_linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz

6. cd wkhtmltox/bin

7. sudo chown root:root wkhtmltopdf

8. sudo cp wkhtmltopdf /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf

9. wkhtmltopdf --version
  # wkhtmltopdf 0.12.3 (with patched qt)
 
 # to avoid "failed loading image" errors and unexplained "wkhtmltopdf died" errors

10. ulimit -n 8192
