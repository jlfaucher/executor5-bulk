<title>Rexx C++ Application Programming Interfaces</title>
<para>This appendix describes how to interface applications to Rexx or extend
the Rexx language by using Rexx C++ application programming interfaces (APIs).
As used here, the term application refers to programs
written in C++. 
</para>
<para>The features described here let a C++ application extend many parts of the
Rexx language or extend an application with Rexx. This includes creating handlers
for Rexx methods, external functions, and system exits. </para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Rexx methods</term>
<listitem><para>are extensions to ooRexx classes. An ooRexx class can define a
method as being contained in an external shared library.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Functions</term>
<listitem><para>are direct extensions of the Rexx language. An application can create
functions that extend the native Rexx function set. Functions can be general-purpose
extensions or specific to an application.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>System exits</term>
<listitem><para>are programmer-defined variations of the operating system.
The application programmer can tailor the Rexx interpreter behavior by
replacing Rexx system requests.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>Methods, functions, and system exit handlers have similar coding, 
compilation, and packaging characteristics.
</para>
<para>In addition, applications can call methods defined on an ooRexx class and
execute them from externally defined methods and functions.</para>

<section id="intertreterapi"><title>Rexx Interpreter API</title>
