<chapter id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>This book describes the Open Object Rexx,
or Object Rexx programming language. In the following, it is called Rexx unless
compared to its traditional predecessor.</para>
<para>This book is aimed at developers familiar with
<trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> and
<trademark class="registered">Unix</trademark>
who want to use Rexx for object-oriented programming, or a mix of traditional
and object-oriented programming.</para>
<para>This book assumes you are already familiar with the techniques of traditional
structured programming, and uses them as a springboard for quickly understanding
Rexx and, in particular, Object Rexx. This approach is designed to help experienced
programmers get involved quickly with the Rexx language, exploit its virtues,
and become productive fast.</para>

<section id="whoshouldread"><title>Who Should Read This Book</title>
<para>Anyone interested in getting a basic understanding of object-oriented concepts
should read this book. Experienced programmers can learn about the Rexx language
and how it is like and unlike other structured programming languages. Programmers
who want to broaden their programming knowledge can learn object-oriented
programming with Rexx. Users already experienced with Rexx can learn about
object-oriented programming (OO) in general, and OO programming with Rexx
in particular.</para>
<para>Programmers who want to make their applications (typically coded in C)
scriptable by Rexx, extend the Rexx language, or control Rexx scripts from
other applications should read the application programming interface (API)
information.</para>

<section id="whattoknow"><title>What You Should Know before Reading This Book</title>
<para>To most effectively use the information contained in this book, you should
know how to: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Program with a traditional language like C, Basic, or Pascal.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Use basic Windows commands for manipulating files,
such as COPY, DELETE, and DIR.
The more familiar you are with Windows, the better.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>If you have little or no experience with the Windows operating system,
refer to the documentation provided with it. You should also have the
<citetitle pubwork="book">Open Object Rexx: Reference</citetitle> at hand.</para>

<section><title>A Note About Program Examples in this Document</title>
<para>The program examples in this document are rendered in a mono-spaced
font that is not completely compatible for cut-and-paste functionality.
Pasting text into an editor could result in some characters outside of
the standard ASCII character set. Specifically, single-quote and
double-quote characters are sometimes converted incorrectly when
pasted into an editor.</para>
