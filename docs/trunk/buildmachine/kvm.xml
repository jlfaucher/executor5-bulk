<section><title>KVM Setup</title>

<para>There are only a few options to be concerned about in this area.
The most interestting is the ability to specify a different logical
volumn in which to place the guest OS images. It is usually a good idea
not to use the default area as space in this area is usually limited.
We chose to create a special partition to hold all of our guest OS image
files so we could better control the available space.
