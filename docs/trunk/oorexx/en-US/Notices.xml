<para>Any reference to a non-open source product,
program, or service is not intended to state or imply that only
non-open source product, program, or service may be used. Any functionally equivalent
product, program, or service that does not infringe any
Rexx Language Association (RexxLA) intellectual property
right may be used instead. However, it is the user's responsibility to
evaluate and verify the operation of any
non-open source product, program, or service.</para>
<para>Any performance data contained herein was determined in a controlled environment.
Therefore, the results obtained in other operating environments may vary significantly.
Some measurements may have been made on development-level systems and there
is no guarantee that these measurements will be the same on generally available
systems. Furthermore, some measurement may have been estimated through extrapolation.
Actual results may vary. Users of this document should verify the applicable
data for their specific environment.</para>
<para>Information concerning non-open source products was obtained from the suppliers
of those products, their published announcements or other publicly available
sources. RexxLA has not tested those products and cannot confirm the accuracy
of performance, compatibility or any other claims related to non-RexxLA packages.
Questions on the capabilities of non-RexxLA packages should be addressed to the
suppliers of those products.</para>
<para>All statements regarding RexxLA's future direction or intent are subject
to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives
only.</para>
<para>This information contains examples of data and reports used in daily business
operations. To illustrate them as completely as possible, the examples include
the names of individuals, companies, brands, and products. All of these names
are fictitious and any similarity to the names and addresses used by an actual
business enterprise is entirely coincidental.</para>
