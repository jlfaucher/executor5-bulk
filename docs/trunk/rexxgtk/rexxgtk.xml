<preface id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>This book describes the Open Object Rexx RexxGTK Class Library and its
methods.</para>
<para>This book is intended for people who plan to develop applications using
Rexx and GTK. Its users range from the novice, who might have experience in some programming
language but no Rexx or GTK experience, to the experienced application developer,
who might have had some experience with Object Rexx and FTP.</para>
<para>This book is a reference rather than a tutorial. It assumes you are already
familiar with object-oriented programming concepts.</para>
<para>Descriptions include the use and syntax of the language and explain how
the language processor &quot;interprets&quot; the language as a program is running.</para>

<section><title>A Note About Program Examples in this Document</title>
<para>The program examples in this document are rendered in a mono-spaced
font that is not completely compatible for cut-and-paste functionality.
Pasting text into an editor could result in some characters outside of
the standard ASCII character set. Specifically, single-quote and
double-quote characters are sometimes converted incorrectly when
pasted into an editor.</para>

<chapter><title>What is RexxGTK?</title>
<para>RexxGTK is an Object Rexx Class library providing access to the GTK
interface available on most Unix/Linux distributions.
</para>

<para>It is assumed that you are familiar with the basic GTK functionality and can reference
those specific to the system. For more information, refer to the 
<ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/index.html">
<citetitle>GNOME Documentation Library</citetitle></ulink>.</para>

<indexterm><primary>requirements, RexxGTK</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>RexxGTK requirements</primary></indexterm>
<para>The RexxGTK package requires that the operating system have the GTK+ libraries
available.</para>

<section id="installation"><title>Installation</title>
<indexterm><primary>RexxGTK installation</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>installation, RexxGTK</primary></indexterm>
<para>The RexxGTK package is contained in the file
<emphasis role="italic">rexxgtk.cls</emphasis>. This file must be placed in
a directory listed in your LIBPATH. To get access to the class and methods in the RexxGTK
package you must include a ::REQUIRES directive in any Object Rexx script that
uses the class:
<indexterm><primary>::REQUIRES directive, RexxGTK</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>
     .
     .
     .
::requires "rexxgtk.cls"
</programlisting></para>
</section>

<section><title>Classes and Methods</title>
<para>The RexxGTK package is developed around the class structure of the GTK+ system. For
each GTK+ class there is a cooresponding RexxGTK class. Most od the GTK_ functions has a
one to one mapping to a cooresponding RexxGTK method with the arguments and return types
also matching. However, there are exceptions to the mapping, especially in the more
complicated classes where it was determined that a simplified method made more sense in
some cases. Also, sometimes it was preferable to return ooRexx builtin objects as opposed
to the structures returned by the GTK+ function.</para>

<para>In order to make it easy for a novice to learn the RexxGTK classes and methods the
book <citetitle>Foundations of GTK+ Development</citetitle> by Andrew Krause published by
Apress&reg; has been used to create a large number of example programs. A user can obtain
a copy of this book, which is oriented to C programmers, and examine all the example
programs in that book. Each example program has a cooresponding test program contained
in the RexxGTK package. Thus a developer can see how to accomplish the same programs in
the book using the RexxGTK package. This should get a novice started very quickly.</para>

<para>This document is also organized in much the same way that the
<ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/index.html">
<citetitle>GNOME Documentation Library</citetitle></ulink> is organized so locating classes
and methods should be similar.</para>
