<chapter><title>What is RexxGTK?</title>
<para>RexxGTK is an Object Rexx Class library providing access to the GTK
interface available on most Unix/Linux distributions.
</para>

<para>It is assumed that you are familiar with the basic GTK functionality and can reference
those specific to the system. For more information, refer to the 
<ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/index.html">
<citetitle>GNOME Documentation Library</citetitle></ulink>.</para>

<indexterm><primary>requirements, RexxGTK</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>RexxGTK requirements</primary></indexterm>
<para>The RexxGTK package requires that the operating system have the GTK+ libraries
available. The minimum version for the Rexx interpreter is ooRexx 4.0.
RexxGTK does not work with any other Rexx interpreter/compiler.</para>

<section id="linuxinstallation"><title>Linux Installation</title>
<indexterm><primary>Linux installation</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>installation</primary>
<secondary>Linux</secondary></indexterm>
<para>The RexxGTK package is contained in the file
<emphasis role="italic">rexxgtk.so</emphasis>. This file must be placed in
a directory listed in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or in the system library path.
RexxGTK also requires an ooRexx class file (<emphasis role="italic">rexxgtk.cls</emphasis>).
This file must be placed in a directory listed in your PATH.
To get access to the class and methods in the RexxGTK
package you must include a ::REQUIRES directive in any Object Rexx script that
uses the class:
<indexterm><primary>::REQUIRES directive</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>
     .
     .
     .
::requires "rexxgtk.cls"
</programlisting></para>
</section>

<secondary>Windows Linux</secondary></indexterm>
<para>The RexxGTK package is contained in the file
<emphasis role="italic">rexxgtk.dll</emphasis>. This file must be placed in
a directory listed in your PATH.
RexxGTK also requires an ooRexx class file (<emphasis role="italic">rexxgtk.cls</emphasis>).
This file must be placed in a directory listed in your PATH.
To get access to the class and methods in the RexxGTK
package you must include a ::REQUIRES directive in any Object Rexx script that
uses the class:
<indexterm><primary>::REQUIRES directive</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>
     .
     .
     .
::requires "rexxgtk.cls"
</programlisting></para>
</section>

<section><title>Classes and Methods</title>
<para>The RexxGTK package is developed around the class structure of the GTK+ system. For
each GTK+ class there is a cooresponding RexxGTK class. Most of the GTK_ functions have a
one to one mapping to a cooresponding RexxGTK method with the arguments and return types
also matching. However, there are exceptions to the mapping, especially in the more
complicated classes where it was determined that a simplified method made more sense in
some cases. Also, sometimes it was preferable to return ooRexx builtin objects as opposed
to the structures returned by the GTK+ function.</para>

<para>In order to make it easy for a novice to learn the RexxGTK classes and methods the
book <citetitle>Foundations of GTK+ Development</citetitle> by Andrew Krause published by
Apress&reg; has been used to create a large number of example programs. A user can obtain
a copy of this book, which is oriented to C programmers, and examine all the example
programs in that book. Each example program has a cooresponding test program contained
in the RexxGTK package. Thus a developer can see how to accomplish the same programs in
the book using the RexxGTK package. This should get a novice started very quickly.</para>

<para>This document is also organized in much the same way that the
<ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/index.html">
<citetitle>GNOME Documentation Library</citetitle></ulink> is organized so locating classes
and methods reference manual should be similar.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Other Notes</title>
<para>Currently the RexxGTK package is not a complete replication of all GTK+ classes and
functions (methods). There are many missing widgets and even more missing functions
(methods). It is the intent of the RexxGTK developers to include as many widgets as 
feasible in the package over time. The same is true for GTK+ functions, but in this case
it may take a much longer period of time and it may never be complete.</para>
