<para>Open Object Rexx comes with
a utility called RexxC. You can use this utility to produce versions of your
programs that do not include the original program source. You can use these
programs to replace any Rexx program file that includes the source, with the
following restrictions: </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The SOURCELINE built-in function returns
<computeroutput>0</computeroutput> for the number of
lines in the program and raises an error for all attempts to retrieve a line.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A sourceless program may not be traced. The TRACE instruction runs without
error, but no tracing of instruction lines, expression results, or intermediate
expression values occurs.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<para>The syntax of the REXXC utility is:</para>

                     +-outputfile-+  +- -s -+
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>If you specify the <emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>,
the language processor processes the
<emphasis role="italic">inputfile</emphasis>
and writes the executable version of the program to the
<emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>. If the
<emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis> already exists, it is
replaced.</para>
<para>If the language processor detects a syntax error while processing the program,
it reports the error and stops processing without creating a new output file.
If you omit the <emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>,
the language processor performs a syntax
check on the program without writing the executable version to a file.</para>
<para>You can use the <emphasis role="italic">/s</emphasis> option to suppress
the display of the information about the interpreter used.</para>

<note>
<para>You can use the in-storage capabilities of the RexxStart programming
interface to process the file image of the output file.</para></note>
<para>With version 2.1, the tokenized form has changed. All Open Object
Rexx for Windows editions contain a utility called RxMigrate that
can be used to change old tokenized forms to the new one. The recommended
procedure is to create a new tokenized file from the original source with
the new version of Open Object Rexx. However, if the source code is no longer available,
RxMigrate can be used to convert the old tokenized file. The syntax of the
RxMigrate utility is:</para>
