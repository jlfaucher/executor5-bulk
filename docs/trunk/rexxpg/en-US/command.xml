<chapter id="command"><title>Commands</title>
<indexterm><primary>commands</primary></indexterm>
<para>From a Rexx program you can
pass commands to Windows and Unix/Linux shells or to applications designed to
work with Rexx. When used to run operating system commands, Rexx becomes a
powerful substitute for the Windows Batch Facility or Unix shell scripts. You can
use variables, control structures,
mathematics, and parsing, and the full object oriented features of Rexx.
</para>
<para>Applications that are designed to
<indexterm><primary>scriptable applications</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>environment for scriptable applications</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>macros</primary>
<secondary>definition</secondary></indexterm>
work with Rexx are often referred to as scriptable applications.
To work with Rexx, a scriptable application registers a command environment with Rexx.
An environment serves as a kind of workspace
shared between Rexx and the application that accepts application
commands issued from your Rexx programs.</para>
<para>For example, many editors
provide a command prompt or dialog box from which you can issue commands
to set margins or add lines. If the editor is scriptable from Rexx, you can
issue the same editor commands from a Rexx program. These Rexx programs are referred
to as macros.</para>
<para>When an application runs a Rexx macro, Rexx directs commands to the application's
environment. The application processes the command, and returns a status indicator as
a return code.</para>
<para>The Rexx
<indexterm><primary>ADDRESS instruction</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>instructions</primary>
<secondary>ADDRESS</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Rexx</primary>
<secondary>ADDRESS instruction</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Rexx</primary>
<secondary>default environment</secondary></indexterm>
ADDRESS instruction allows you select which named command environment commands get
directed to.  There is always at least one active command environment, and all
Rexx programs start with a default environment selected.  For programs launched from
a command shell, an operating-system-specific command handler is the normal default.  Applications
(such as an editor) can choose whether or not to make their own command environment the default.
</para>

<section id="cmds"><title>How to Issue Commands</title>
<para>Rexx makes it easy to issue commands. The basic rule is that whatever Rexx
cannot process directly gets passed to the current command environment. You can: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Allow Rexx to evaluate part or all of a clause as an expression. Rexx
automatically passes the resulting string to the default environment.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Enclose the entire clause in quotation marks. This makes it a literal
string for Rexx to pass to the default environment.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Send a command explicitly to a command environment using
the ADDRESS instruction.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Rexx processes your program one clause at a time. It examines each clause
to determine if it is: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>A directive, such as ::CLASS or ::METHOD</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A message instruction, such as:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
.array~new
]]>
</programlisting></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A keyword instruction, such as: </para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
say "Type total number"
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>or </para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
pull input
]]>
</programlisting></listitem>
<listitem><para>A variable assignment (any valid symbol followed by an equal sign), such
as:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
price = cost * 1.2
]]>
</programlisting></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A label for calling other routines</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A null (empty) clause</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>If the clause is none of the above, Rexx evaluates the entire clause as
an expression and passes the resulting string to the current command environment.</para>
<para>If the string is a valid valid command for that environment, the command
handler will process it as if you had entered it at the command prompt.
</para>
<para>The following example shows a Rexx clause that uses the Windows DIR
command to display a list of files in the current directory. </para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* display current directory */
say "DIR command using Rexx"
dir
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>The clause <computeroutput>dir</computeroutput> is not a Rexx
instruction or a label, so Rexx evaluates it and passes the resulting
string to Windows. Windows recognizes
the string DIR as one of its commands and processes it.</para>
<para>Letting Rexx evaluate the command as an expression might cause
problems, however. Try adding a path to the DIR command in the above program
(such as, <computeroutput>dir c:\config.sys</computeroutput>). The Windows
command in this case is
an incorrect Rexx expression. The program ends with an error.</para>
<para>A safer way to issue commands is by enclosing the command in
quotes, which makes the command a literal string. Rexx does not evaluate the
contents of strings, so the string is passed to Windows as-is.
Here is an example using the PATH command:</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* display current path      */
say "PATH command using Rexx"
"path"
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>The following example, DP.CMD, shows a program using the DIR
and PATH commands. The PAUSE command is added to wait for the user to press
a key before issuing the next instruction or command. Borders are added too.</para>
<example>
<title>DIR and PATH commands</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* DP.CMD -- Issue DIR and PATH commands to Windows */

say "="~copies(40)    /* display line of equal   */
                      /* signs (=) for a border  */

"dir"                 /* display listing of      */
                      /* the current directory   */

"pause"               /* pauses processing and   */
                      /* tells user to "Press    */
                      /* any key to continue."   */

say "="~copies(40)    /* display line of =       */
"path"                /* display the current     */
                      /* PATH setting            */
]]>
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>When you specify the following:</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

</programlisting>
<para>a possible output would be:</para>

<note>
<para>Usually, when executing a host command addressed to the Windows or
Unix/Linux command shell,
a new process is
created in the system command handler to execute the command.
Changes in a child process environment do not change
the parent process environment. Therefore, any change in the
environment, such as a directory change, made by a host command
executed in a child process would not be reflected in the process
running the Rexx program.</para>

<para>The interpreter attempts to mitigate this to some extent by
executing some host commands in the process running the Rexx
program, rather than in a child process. This is done so that
changes to the environment made by executing the host command are
visible in the process running the Rexx program.</para>

<para>This is only done when the host command line is simple. That is,
the command line must contain a single command, without redirection
and without pipe. On Windows this applies to the
<computeroutput>CD</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>SET</computeroutput>
commands. On Unix-like systems, including Linux, this applies to
<computeroutput>cd</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>set</computeroutput>,
<computeroutput>unset</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>export</computeroutput>.
Rather than remembering the rules, it may be easier to avoid a potential problem
by using the built in <computeroutput>directory()</computeroutput> or
<computeroutput>value()</computeroutput> functions rather than issuing a host command
for <computeroutput>cd</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>set</computeroutput>, etc.</para>

<section id="bldcom"><title>Using Variables to Build Commands</title>
<para>You can use variables to build commands. The SHOFIL.CMD program
is an example. SHOFIL types a file that the user specifies. It prompts the
user to enter a file name and then builds a variable containing the TYPE command
and the input file name.</para>
<para>To have Rexx issue the command to the operating system, put the variable
containing the command string on a line by itself. Rexx evaluates the variable
and passes the resultant string to Windows: </para>
<example>
<title>SHOFIL.CMD (Windows)</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* SHOFIL.CMD - build command with variables  */

/* prompt the user for a file name            */
say "Type a file name:"

/* assign the response to variable FILENAME   */
pull filename

/* build a command string by concatenation    */
commandstr = "TYPE" filename

/* Assuming the user typed "demo.txt,"        */
/* the variable COMMANDSTR contains           */
/* the string "TYPE DEMO.TXT" and so...       */

commandstr           /* ...Rexx passes the    */
                     /* string on to Windows  */

<section id="quotmks"><title>Using Quotation Marks</title>
<para>The rules for forming a command from an expression are the same
as those for forming expressions. Be careful with symbols that are used in
Rexx and Windows programs. The DIRREX.CMD program
below shows how Rexx evaluates a command when the command name and a variable
name are the same: </para>
<example>
<title>DIRREX.CMD (Windows)</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* DIRREX.CMD - assign a value to the symbol DIR  */
say "DIR command using Rexx"
dir = "echo This is not a directory."

/* pass the evaluated variable to Windows         */
dir
]]>
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>Because dir is a variable that contains a string, the string
is passed to the system. The DIR command is not executed. Here are the results: </para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
[C:\]rexx dirrex
DIR command using Rexx:
This is not a directory.
[C:\]
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>Rexx evaluates a literal string--a string enclosed in matching quotation
marks--exactly as it is. To ensure that a symbol in a command is not
evaluated as a variable, enclose it in matching quotation marks as follows:</para>
<example>
<title>Passing values to command environments</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* assign a value to the symbol DIR         */
say "DIR command using Rexx"
dir = "echo This is another string now."

/* pass the literal string "dir" to Windows */
"dir"
]]>
</programlisting>
</example>
<para>Rexx displays a directory listing.</para>
<para>The best way to ensure that Rexx passes a string to the system as a command
is to enclose the entire clause in quotation marks. This is especially important
when you use symbols that Rexx uses as operators.</para>
<para>If you want to use a variable in the command string, leave the variable
outside the quotation marks. For example: </para>
<programlisting>

<section id="rcodes"><title>Using Return Codes from Commands</title>
<indexterm><primary>return code from Windows and Linux</primary></indexterm>
<para>With each command it processes, Windows and Unix/Linux

assigned to a special built-in Rexx
<indexterm><primary>RC special variable</primary></indexterm>
variable named RC.</para>
<para>If the command was processed without problems, the return code is almost
always 0. If something goes wrong, the return code issued is a nonzero number.
The number depends on the command itself and the error encountered.</para>
<para>This example shows how to display a return code: </para>

<indexterm><primary>condition traps</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>trapping command errors</primary></indexterm>
<para>The most efficient way to detect errors from
commands is by creating condition traps, using the
SIGNAL ON and CALL ON instructions, with either the ERROR or the FAILURE condition.
When used in a program, these instructions enable, or switch on, a detector
in Rexx that tests the result of every command. Then, if a command signals
an error, Rexx stops usual program processing, searches the program for the
appropriate label (ERROR:, or FAILURE:, or a label that you created), and
resumes processing there.</para>

<indexterm><primary>Rexx</primary>
<secondary>CALL instruction</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Rexx</primary>
<secondary>SIGNAL instruction</secondary></indexterm>
<para>SIGNAL ON and CALL ON also tell Rexx to store
the line number (in the Rexx program) of the command instruction that triggered
the condition. Rexx assigns that line number to the special variable SIGL.
<indexterm><primary>SIGL special variable</primary></indexterm>
Your program can get more information about what caused the command error
<indexterm><primary>CONDITION built-in function</primary></indexterm>
through the built-in function CONDITION.</para>
<para>Using the SIGNAL and CALL instructions to handle errors has several advantages;
namely, that programs: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Are easier to read because you can confine error-trapping to a single,
common routine</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Are more flexible because they can respond to errors by clause (SIGL),
by return code (RC), or by other information (CONDITION method or built-in
function)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Can catch problems and react to them before the environment issues an
error message</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Are easier to correct because you can turn the traps on and off (SIGNAL
OFF and CALL OFF)</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>For other conditions that can be detected using SIGNAL ON and CALL ON,
see the <citetitle>Open Object Rexx: Reference.</citetitle></para>

<section id="instrcond"><title>Instructions and Conditions</title>
<para>The instructions to set a trap for errors are SIGNAL and CALL. Example
formats are: </para>
<programlisting>
SIGNAL ON <emphasis role="italic">condition</emphasis> NAME <emphasis role="italic">trapname</emphasis>
CALL   ON <emphasis role="italic">condition</emphasis> NAME <emphasis role="italic">trapname</emphasis>
</programlisting>
<para>The SIGNAL ON instruction initiates an exit subroutine that ends the program.
The CALL ON instruction initiates a subroutine that can return processing to
the clause immediately following the CALL ON instruction. You use CALL ON
to recover from a command error or failure.</para>
<para>The command conditions that can be trapped are: </para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>ERROR
<indexterm><primary>ERROR condition</primary></indexterm>
</term>
<listitem><para>Detects any nonzero error code the default environment
issues as the result of a Rexx command.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>FAILURE
<indexterm><primary>FAILURE condition</primary></indexterm>
</term>
<listitem><para>Detects a severe error, preventing the system from
processing the command.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>A failure, in this sense, is a particular category of error. If you use
SIGNAL ON or CALL ON to set a trap only for ERROR conditions, then it traps
failures as well as other errors. If you also specify a FAILURE condition,
then the ERROR trap ignores failures.</para>
<para>With both the SIGNAL and the CALL instructions, you can specify the name
of the trap routine. Add a NAME keyword followed by the name of the subroutine.
If you do not specify the name of the trap routine, Rexx uses the value of
<emphasis role="italic">condition</emphasis> as the name (Rexx looks for
the label ERROR:, FAILURE:, and so on).</para>
<para>For more information about other conditions that can be trapped, see
the <citetitle pubwork="book">Open Object Rexx: Reference.</citetitle></para>
</section>

<section id="disabl"><title>Disabling Traps</title>
<para>To turn off a trap for any part of a program, use the SIGNAL or CALL
instructions with the OFF keyword, such as: </para>
<example>
<title>SIGNAL</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
SIGNAL OFF ERROR
SIGNAL OFF FAILURE
CALL OFF ERROR
CALL OFF FAILURE

</section>

<section id="signal"><title>Using SIGNAL ON ERROR</title>
<para>The following example shows how a program can use SIGNAL ON to
trap a command error in a program that copies a file. In this example, an
error occurs because the name of a nonexistent file is stored in the variable
file1. Processing jumps to the clause following the label ERROR:</para>
