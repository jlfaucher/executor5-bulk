<indexterm><primary>rexxc utility</primary></indexterm>
<para>Open Object Rexx comes with
a utility called rexxc. You can use this utility to produce versions of your
programs that do not include the original program source. You can use these
programs to replace any Rexx program file that includes the source, with the
following restrictions: </para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The SOURCELINE built-in function returns
<computeroutput>0</computeroutput> for the number of
lines in the program and raises an error for all attempts to retrieve a line.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A sourceless program may not be traced. The TRACE instruction runs without
error, but no tracing of instruction lines, expression results, or intermediate
expression values occurs.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>The syntax of the rexxc utility on Unix systems is:</para>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/rexxc_unix.svg" align="center" scale="50" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>The syntax of the rexxc utility on Windows systems is:</para>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/rexxc_windows.svg" align="center" scale="50" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>If you specify the <emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>,
the language processor processes the
<emphasis role="italic">inputfile</emphasis>
and writes the executable version of the program to the
<emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis> (a binary file). If the
<emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis> already exists, it is
replaced.</para>

<para>If the language processor detects a syntax error while processing the program,
it reports the error and stops processing without creating a new output file.
If you omit the <emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>,
the language processor performs a syntax
check on the program without writing the executable version to a file.</para>

<para>You can use the <emphasis role="italic">s</emphasis> option (<emphasis role="italic">-s</emphasis>
or <emphasis role="italic">/s</emphasis>) to suppress the display of the information about the interpreter used.</para>

<para>You can use the <emphasis role="italic">e</emphasis> option (<emphasis role="italic">-e</emphasis>
or <emphasis role="italic">/e</emphasis>) to <emphasis role="italic">base64</emphasis> encode the resulting
binary file which makes it possible to deploy it in environments where usually character transformations take place on
scripts before Rexx gets them for execution.</para>

<note>
<!--
<para>Binary files produced by a version of <code>rexxc</code> can only be run on an interpreter of the
same or higher language level and the same bitness as the interpreter that the compiling copy of <code>rexxc</code>
was supplied with.</para>
-->
<para>Binary files produced by rexxc   can be run only on an interpreter of the same bitness and the same
(or higher) language level as that of the rexxc   that created them.</para>
