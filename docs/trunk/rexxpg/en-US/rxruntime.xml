<para>Open Object Rexx comes with
a utility called RexxC. You can use this utility to produce versions of your
programs that do not include the original program source. You can use these
programs to replace any Rexx program file that includes the source, with the
following restrictions: </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The SOURCELINE built-in function returns
<computeroutput>0</computeroutput> for the number of
lines in the program and raises an error for all attempts to retrieve a line.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A sourceless program may not be traced. The TRACE instruction runs without
error, but no tracing of instruction lines, expression results, or intermediate
expression values occurs.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<para>The syntax of the REXXC utility is:</para>
<indexterm><primary>REXXC utility</primary></indexterm>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/rexxc.svg" align="center" scale="50" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>If you specify the <emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>,
the language processor processes the
<emphasis role="italic">inputfile</emphasis>
and writes the executable version of the program to the
<emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>. If the
<emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis> already exists, it is
replaced.</para>
<para>If the language processor detects a syntax error while processing the program,
it reports the error and stops processing without creating a new output file.
If you omit the <emphasis role="italic">outputfile</emphasis>,
the language processor performs a syntax
check on the program without writing the executable version to a file.</para>
<para>You can use the <emphasis role="italic">s</emphasis> option (<emphasis role="italic">/s</emphasis>
on Windows and <emphasis role="italic">-s</emphasis> on unixes) to suppress the display of the
information about the interpreter used.
</para>

<note>
<para>You can use the in-storage capabilities of the RexxStart programming
interface to process the file image of the output file.</para></note>
<para>
  Due to changes in the 4.0 interpreter it is not possible for Rexx programs, tokenized with any previous
  version of ooRexx, to run under ooRexx 4.0.0.  The programs will need to be re-tokenized with the 4.0.0
  interpreter. The changes are such that the old tokenized form can not be changed to the new form.
  Therefore, no utility such as the old <computeroutput>RxMigrate</computeroutput> can be provided. Part
  of the purpose of the changes is to make this sitaution less likely to occur in the future.
