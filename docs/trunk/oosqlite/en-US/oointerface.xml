<chapter id="chpOOInteface"><title>The Object Orientated Interface to SQLite</title>
<indexterm><primary>Object Orientated Interface</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  The object-orientated interface to SQLite provides a number of classes whose methods are used to work with SQLite
  databases.
</para>
<para>
  The intent is for the object-orientated interface to allow access to the complete functionality and feature set of
  SQLite. The first release of ooSQLite will not meet, and is not intended to meet, that goal. Lesser used functionality
  will be added over time.
</para>
<para>
  The object-orientated and <link linkend="chpClassicInteface">classic</link> Rexx interfaces are developed in tandem.
  As each new feature or functionality of SQLite is added to ooSQLite, access to the feature is added to both interfaces
  at the same time. There is no SQLite functionality in the object-orientated interface that can not be accessed through
  the classic Rexx interface. And, vice versa.
</para>
<para>
  The following table lists the classes used in the object orientated interface of the ooSQLite package:

<row>
<entry><link linkend="clsOOSQLite">The ooSQLite Class</link></entry>
<entry>The ooSQLite class provieds a number of <emphasis role="italic">class</emphasis> methods that are generally useful in working with SQLite databases. Many of the methods are used to query or set values in the database <emphasis role="italic">engine</emphasis> rather than an individual database.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry><link linkend="clsOOSQLiteBackup">The ooSQLiteBackup Class</link></entry>
<entry>An ooSQLiteBackup object provides methods for copying the content of one database into another. It is useful either for creating backups of databases or for copying in-memory databases to or from persistent files.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry><link linkend="clsOOSQLiteConnection">The ooSQLiteConnection Class</link></entry>
<entry>Each ooSQLiteConnection object represents an open connection to a SQLite database. Mulitple connections to the same database are allowed by instantiating multiple ooSQLiteConnection objects.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry><link linkend="chpOOSQLiteConstants">The ooSQLiteConstants Class</link></entry>
<entry>The ooSQLiteConstants class provides a CONSTANT value for each SQLite defined constant, and a small number of ooSQLite specific constants.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry><link linkend="clsOOSQLiteMutex">The ooSQLiteMutex Class</link></entry>
<entry>An ooSQLiteMutex object provides methods for allocating and using a mutex. In general a mutex is a synchronization object used in multi-threading programs to prevent different threads from acessing a shared resource at the same time.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry><link linkend="clsOOSQLiteStmt">The ooSQLiteStmt Class</link></entry>
<entry>Each ooSQLiteStmt object represents a single SQL statement, which is often referred to as a <emphasis role="italic">prepared</emphasis> statment.</entry>
