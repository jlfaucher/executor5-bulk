<chapter id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>
  This book describes the ooSQLite framework, which is implemented as an external library package for ooRexx. External
  library packages are often called <emphasis role="italic">extensions</emphasis>, or <emphasis role="italic">native
  extensions</emphasis>. The library package extends the capability of the Rexx interpreter by adding functionality or
  features not present in the base interpreter.
</para>
<para>
  The ooSQLite library package gives programmers access to the SQLite database engine directly from their Rexx programs.
  This book describes the Classes, Methods, and Funtions in ooSQLite that allow that access and describes how to use
  them.
</para>

<section id="whoshoulduse"><title>Who Should Use This Book</title>
<para>
  This book is intended for Open Object Rexx programmers who are using or intend to use ooSQLite in their Rexx
  programs. The book does not teach SQL nor relational database design or management. It provides a basic introduction
  to using SQLite through the documentation of the classes and functions available in ooSQLite. In depth documentation
  of SQLite is provided by the developers of SQLite at their <ulink
  url="http://www.sqlite.org/index.html">website</ulink>, not in this book.
</para>
</section>

<section id="bookstructure"><title>How This Book is Structured</title>
<para>
  This book is primarily a reference to the classes and functions in ooSQLite. ooSQLite provides an object-orientated
  interface and a classic Rexx interface to SQLite. The book is broken into two main sections. The first section
  describes the object-orientated interface and the second section describes the classic Rexx section. Preceding the
  object-orientated section are the two chapters, <emphasis role="italic">About This Book</emphasis> and <emphasis
  role="italic">Brief Overview</emphasis>. They contain a small amount of overall information. A detailed index follows
  the classic Rexx section.
</para>
<para>
  The object-orientated section contains a reference for each class in ooSQLite. Each class reference contains a single
  section for every class, instance, and attribute method of the class. The first section in a class reference is a
  table listing every method with a brief description and a link to the detailed documentation for the method.
</para>
<para>
  Each method section starts with a <link linkend="syndia">syntax</link> diagram as a synopsis of how to invoke the
  method. Text follows describing the method, listing each argument to the method, and the return from the method. Most
  method sections have a <emphasis role="italic">remarks</emphasis> component discussing the method in more detail. Most
  method sections also have a <emphasis role="italic">details</emphasis> component pointing to the SQLite documentation
  that is most relevant to the method. To fully understand the use of any single method, the reader should also consult
  the SQLite documentation relevant to that method. Finally, many, but not all, of the method sections end with a short
  code snippet as an example of using the method.
</para>
<para>
  The classic Rexx section starts with a table that lists every function available for the classic Rexx programmer. This
  table is similar to the method table that begins each class reference. The table contains a brief description of the
  function and a link to the detailed documentation for the function. Each function is fully documented in a single
  section.
</para>
<para>
  The reference for each single function is very similar to the reference to each single method. It starts with a syntax
  diagram, describes the function, lists the arguments and return. It usually has a remarks component. The details
  component points the way to the authoritative SQLite documentation. Some, but not all function references contain an
  example.
</para>
<para>
  Each method and function reference is meant to be stand alone. All the details to use any method or function are
  included within the section for that method or function. Each method and function is listed in the index. The reader
  can look up any function or method in the index or the table of contents and go straight to the reference for the
  function or method.
</para>
<para>
  Within the reference for a single class, each method appears in alphabetical order. Likewise the reference for each
  function appears in this reference manual in alphabetical order.
</para>

<para>
  There is a wealth of information on SQLite and how to use SQLite on the Web. This information is directly applicable
  to using ooSQLite. The SQLite <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/index.html">home</ulink> page is the authoritative
  answer to any SQLite question. In addition there is a SQLiter users mailing <ulink
  url="http://sqlite.org:8080/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/sqlite-users">list</ulink> that can be subscribed to.

<section id="syndia"><title>How to Read the Syntax Diagrams</title>
<para>
  Throughout this book, syntax is described using the structure defined below. This is similar to, but slightly
  different than, the IBM syntax diagrams used in other ooRexx reference documentation.  The author is calling these
  diagrams <emphasis role="italic">simplified railroad tracks</emphasis>. It primarily strives to limit all diagrams to
  2 lines, and does away with much of the complexity of true IBM railroad tracks. The body of text following the
  syntax diagrams will resolve any ambiguities in the diagram.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
  Read the syntax diagrams from left to right, from top to bottom, following the path of the line.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>&gt;&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol indicates the beginning of a statement.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>---&gt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates that the statement syntax is continued on the next
  line. In most cases statement continuation is avoided.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol indicates that a statement is continued from the previous line.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>---&gt;&lt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates the end of a statement.
</para>
<para>
  Diagrams of syntactical units other than complete statements start with the <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput>
  symbol and end with the  <computeroutput>---&gt;</computeroutput> symbol.

<para>
  In this reference, the syntax being presented is the syntax for method invocations and function calls. The diagrams
  show the method, or function, names and their arguments.  For method invocations, the section the method is included
  in, and / or the text itself, make it clear as to which class the method belongs to.  The arguments to the method or
  function are enclosed in parenthesis and separated by commas.  The arguments are represented by appropriate variable
  names and these variable names are then described in the text for the method.  When arguments are optional, the
  default value and or behavior if the argument is omitted is also described in the text.  In all cases, the text rather
  than the syntax diagram should be considered definitive.
