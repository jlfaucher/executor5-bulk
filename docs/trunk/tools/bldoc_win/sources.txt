Sources for the tools in this package
-------------------------------------

This package contains multiple tools and files which were collected from various
locations.  In most cases they are being used unmodified but in others, changes
have been made.  This file provides information on where the tools were found in
case the user needs further documentation about them.

Fonts
-----

The stylesheets supplied by Publican call for the use of two sets of fonts that
were developed by RedHat - Liberation Sans and Liberation Mono.  These font
packages are available here:
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/liberation-sans
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/liberation-mono
The unzipped contents of both are provided in the Liberation Fonts sub-folder.

XSLTPROC
--------

This is the transform tool whose home page is here:
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html
A link on that page takes you to the page where the Windows binaries can be
downloaded: https://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/
There are actually four packages that are required: libxlt, libxml, iconv and
zlib.  As a convenience, the unzipped versions of those packages are included as
sub-folders of this package.  Each of them has a bin\ directory containing the
executables that must be accessible.  Rather than adding them to the path, the
contents have been copied to the main package directory.  No changes were made.

FOP
---

This is the Apache tool used to create the PDF whose home page is here:
https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.4/
The unzipped version of this package is included as a sub-folder.  As the
program is run by executing a .bat file, nothing needed to be copied in order to
make it accessible.  No changes were made.

Stylesheets
-----------

The majority of the stylesheets are loaded from DocBook on the Web but four are
copied from the Publican tools located in our SVN repository on Source Forge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx/files/windows-build-tools/
The file PublicanWindows.zip contains a directory Publican\xsl\ and from it the
files defaults.xsl, pdf.xsl, html.xsl, and xhtml-common.xsl have been copied.
In addition, pdf.xsl has been modified to remove a Publican-supplied fix for a
problem with footnotes since it is now fixed by DocBook itself, to turn off
using extensions for tablecolumns as we are not using Perl, to add templates for
the removal of leading and trailing blank lines from our examples, and to add a
parameter to set the depth for the Table Of Contents to 3 in order to match the
historical look of our documents.  The html.xsl file has been modified to import
the chunkfast.xsl file rather than chunk.xsl in order to improve performance on
the larger documents and to add a parameter to suppress the messages produced as
each individual HTML file is produced.  Finally, the xhtml-common.xsl file has
been modified to supply the title for the web pages which had been passed as a
parameter by Publican, to turn off using extensions for tablecolumns as we are
not using Perl, to turn off scaling of images as they are now SVG format, and to
remove a section referring to Publican that was inserted into the Web pages.

Configuration File for FOP
--------------------------

In order for FOP to find the graphics files that it is to include in the PDF, it
needs information that is supplied in a configuration file, fop.cfg.  This file
also tells it to determine the fonts that are available for use on the system so
it will use the Liberation fonts if they have been installed.  This file was
created based on the sample fop.xconf provided in the fop package.

Command Files
-------------

In order to simply the execution of the tools and hide the specific syntax they
require, several command files were written.  Their use is described in the file
read1st.txt.

ooRexx Programs
---------------

Three small programs were written to automate the installation of the packages
for the Fonts, XSLTPROC and FOP, and to check that the creation of either the
PDF or the HTML files was successful.  The command files run the last two so
that accurate messages are produced when the command files terminate.
