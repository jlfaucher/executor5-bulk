    The version of ooDialog distributed in ooRexx 5.0.0 is ooDialog 4.2.3.
  </para>
  <para>
     Beginning with ooDialog version 4.2.0, released August 2012, both the ooDialog version number and the installation of
     ooDialog itself have been decoupled from the ooRexx interpreter.
  </para>
  <para>
    Any version of ooDialog from version 4.0.0 to version 4.2.3 can be installed into an ooRexx 5.0.0 installation. The
    ooDialog version installed completely replaces whatever version of ooDialog is currently installed.
  </para>
  <para>
    ooDialog versions can be downloaded from SourceForge at: <ulink
    url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx/files/ooDialog/"><citetitle>ooRexx Files ooDialog</citetitle></ulink>
  </para>
  <para>
    ooDialog version 4.2.0 was completely rewritten from the original IBM implementation to take advantage of the powerful
    new native APIs provided by ooRexx 4.0.0.  ooDialog 4.2.3 is far more powerful, has many more features, and is more
    capable than the orignal ooDialog.
  </para>
  <para>
    While every effort has been made to ensure that ooDialog 4.2.0 and later is entirely backwards compatible with the
    original IBM implementation, there are a few reports of some small number of existing ooDialog programs that have
    problems under ooDialog 4.2.3.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is the intention of the development team that ooDialog 4.2.3 is backwards compatible with previous versions of
    ooDialog.  If an ooDialog programmer or user discovers a case where this is not so, he or she should open up a bug
    report on SourceForge, or at the very least discuss the problem on the ooRexx Users list.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the problem can be fixed, it will be.  If it can not be fixed, the reason for that will be explained.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is the intent that the version of ooDialog distributed with each new release of ooRexx be the current officially
    released version of ooDialog. If any ooDialog programmer or user is unhappy with the backwards compatibility of that
    version of ooDialog, and they do not find the new features of ooDialog compelling enough, they are advised to install one
    of the earlier versions of ooDialog available on SourceForge.
