<section><title>About The 5.0.0 Release</title>
<para>
  Open Object Rexx Version 5.0.0 is based on the previous version of ooRexx&trade; (4.2.0). Version 5.0.0 has both
  enhancements and bug fixes.
</para>
<note><title>IMPORTANT</title>
<para>
  If you have a version of IBM Object Rexx&trade; installed on your system, you must remove it before
  starting with the installation of this package. The two packages, Object Rexx and ooRexx can not be
  installed side-by-side.
</para>
<para>
  Note that an <emphasis role="underline">upgrade</emphasis> type installation is not supported on any platform.
  If a previous version of ooRexx is installed, it should be completely uninstalled prior to installing 4.0.0.
  Failure to completely uninstall the previous version will produce unpredictable results.
</para>
<para>
  On a Unix-like system use the appropriate package manager to uninstall the previous version. For
  instance, on Linux with a rpm install, you could use the command:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
rpm -iv ooRexx
]]>
</programlisting>
  to uninstall ooRexx. On a Debian-based system you could use the <computeroutput>-r</computeroutput> or the
  <computeroutput>-P</computeroutput> option of <computeroutput>dpkg</computeroutput> to uninstall ooRexx:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
dpkg -P ooRexx
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  On Windows, when the installation program is started, the installer will recognize that a previous version is installed. It
  will then present an option to uninstall the previous version before proceeding with the 5.0.0 install. Alternatively, you
  can completely uninstall the previous version prior to starting the 5.0.0 installation.
</para>
</note>

<warning><title>Warning</title>
<para>
  <emphasis role="italic">On Windows only.</emphasis> If a previous Windows install exists and is not the same addressing
  mode (32 or 64) as the version of ooRexx about to be installed, there are potential problems when the uninstaller is
  launched from the installer automatically. In this case it is <emphasis role="bold">strongly</emphasis> advised that the
  uninstallation program be run first to completely uninstall the current version of ooRexx, and then the new installer be
  run.
</para>

<section><title>The <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> Daemon Process</title>
<para>
  Part of ooRexx is <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> which is a daemon process that manages all
  data that can persist across interpreter invocations or is used for cross-process communications. The
  <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process manages the Rexx data queues, the macrospace, and all of
  the external function, subcommand handler and exit registrations.
</para>
<para>
  In ooRexx 4.0.0, and later versions, the interpreter and <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> communicate through a
  socket interface, rather than through shared memory as in versions of ooRexx prior to 4.0.0.
</para>
<para>
  Ideally, <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> should run as a service. When you install ooRexx from a
  package on Linux, <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> will be set up to run as a system service.
  When installing the Windows package, the default is to install <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput>
  as a Windows service. In this scenario, the operating system will start the
  <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> daemon on boot up and shut the daemon down when the system is
  halted.
</para>
<para>
  If <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> is not installed as a service, the first time the interpreter
  executes, and needs the function provided by <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput>, the interpreter
  will start the daemon process. Once started, the <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process will
  continue to run until the system is halted.
</para>
<para>
  There is little or no point in stopping the <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process once it is
  started. <emphasis role="bold">Be aware</emphasis> that if you do stop the
  <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process, all queues, all registered subcommand handlers, system
  exits, and external functions, and the macrospace, disappear.
</para>
<para>
  When <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> is installed as a service, it can be started and stopped by
  the user, if the user has the proper authority, in the same manner as other services. On Windows, the
  services manager can be used to start or stop <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput>. Or, from the
  command line, net stop or net start can also be used:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\work.ooRexx>net stop rxapi
The RXAPI service is stopping.
The RXAPI service was stopped successfully.

C:\work.ooRexx>net start rxapi

The RXAPI service was started successfully.

C:\work.ooRexx>
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  On Linux, the following can be used from the command line:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]# /etc/init.d/rxapid stop
Stopping rxapi:                                            [  OK  ]
[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]# /etc/init.d/rxapid start
Starting rxapi:                                            [  OK  ]
[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]#
]]>
</programlisting>
  It is likely that your installation of Linux also has a graphical means of starting or stopping
  services.
</para>

<para>
  On AIX, the following can be used from the command line:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

[root@myhost]# stopsrc -s rxapi
0513-044 The rxapi Subsystem was requested to stop.
[root@myhost]# startsrc -s rxapi
0513-059 The rxapi Subsystem has been started. Subsystem PID is 1134614.
[root@myhost]# lssrc -s rxapi
Subsystem         Group            PID          Status
 rxapi                             1134614      active
[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]#
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  If <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> is not installed as a service, it can be stopped by using an
  appropriate process killer for your platform.  Typically the Task Manager on Windows and
  <computeroutput>kill</computeroutput> on a unix-like system.
</para>
