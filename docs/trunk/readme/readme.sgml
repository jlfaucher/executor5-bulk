<section><title>About The 4.0.0 Release</title>
<para>
  Open Object Rexx Version 4.0.0 is based on the previous version of ooRexx&trade; (3.2.0). Version 4.0.0
  has both enhancements and bug fixes.
</para>
<note><title>IMPORTANT</title>
<para>
  If you have a version of IBM Object Rexx&trade; installed on your system, you must remove it before
  starting with the installation of this package. The two packages, Object Rexx and ooRexx can not be
  installed side-by-side.
</para>
<para>
  If a previous version of ooRexx is installed, it should be uninstalled prior to installing 4.0.0.
</para>
<para>
  On Windows, when the installation program is started, the installer will recognize that a previous
  version is installed. It will then present an option to uninstall the previous version before
  proceeding with the 4.0.0 install. Alternatively, you can unistall the previous version prior to
  starting the 4.0.0 installation.
</para>
<para>
  On a Unix-like system use the appropriate package manager to uninstall the previous version. For
  instance, on Linux with a rpm install, you could use the command:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
rpm -iv ooRexx
]]>
</programlisting>
  to uninstall ooRexx.
</para></note>

<section><title>The <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> Daemon Process</title>
<para>
  Part of ooRexx is <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> which is a daemon process that manages all
  data that can persist across interpreter invocations or is used for cross-process communications. The
  <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process manages the Rexx data queues, the macrospace, and all of
  the external function, subcommand handler and exit registrations.
</para>
<para>
  In ooRexx 4.0.0 the interpreter and <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> communicate through a socket
  interface, rather than through shared memory as in previous versions of ooRexx.
</para>
<para>
  Ideally, <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> should run as a service. When you install ooRexx from a
  package on Linux, <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> will be set up to run as a system service.
  When installing the Windows package, the default is to install <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput>
  as a Windows service. In this scenario, the operating system will start the
  <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> daemon on boot up and shut the daemon down when the system is
  halted.
</para>
<para>
  If <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> is not installed as a service, the first time the interpreter
  executes, and needs the function provided by <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput>, the intepreter
  will start the daemon process. Once started, the <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process will
  continue to run until the system is halted.
</para>
<para>
  There is little or no point in stopping the <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process once it is
  started. <emphasis role="bold">Be aware</emphasis> that if you do stop the
  <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> process, all queues, all registered subcommand handlers, system
  exits, and external functions, and the macrospace,
  disappear.
</para>
<para>
  When <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> is installed as a service, it can be started and stopped by
  the user, if the user has the proper authority, in the same manner as other services. On Windows, the
  services manager can be used to start or stop <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput>. Or, from the
  command line, net stop or net start can also be used:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\work.ooRexx>net stop rxapi
The RXAPI service is stopping.
The RXAPI service was stopped successfully.

C:\work.ooRexx>net start rxapi

The RXAPI service was started successfully.

C:\work.ooRexx>
]]>
</programlisting>
  On Linux, the following can be used from the command line:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]# /etc/init.d/rxapid stop
Stopping rxapi:                                            [  OK  ]
[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]# /etc/init.d/rxapid start
Starting rxapi:                                            [  OK  ]
[root@Falcon work.ooRexx]#
]]>
</programlisting>
  It is likely that your installation of Linux also has a graphical means of starting or stopping
  services.
</para>
<para>
  If <computeroutput>rxapi</computeroutput> is not installed as a service, it can be stopped by using an
  appropriate process killer for your platform.  Typically the Task Manager on Windows and
  <computeroutput>kill</computeroutput> on a unix-like system.
