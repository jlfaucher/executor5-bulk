<para>This chapter gives an overview of the arithmetic facilities of the Rexx
language.</para>
<para> Numbers can be expressed flexibly. Leading and trailing whitespace
characters are permitted, and exponential notation can be used. Valid numbers
are, for example:
</para>
<example>
<title>Numbers</title>

<para>The arithmetic operators
<indexterm><primary>operator</primary>
<secondary>arithmetic</secondary>
<tertiary>description</tertiary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>arithmetic</primary>
<secondary>operators</secondary></indexterm>
include addition (<computeroutput>+</computeroutput>),
subtraction (<computeroutput>-</computeroutput>),
multiplication (<computeroutput>*</computeroutput>),
power (<computeroutput>**</computeroutput>),
division (<computeroutput>/</computeroutput>),
prefix plus (<computeroutput>+</computeroutput>), and prefix minus
(<computeroutput>-</computeroutput>). In addition, it includes
integer divide (<computeroutput>%</computeroutput>),
<indexterm><primary>integer</primary>
<secondary>division</secondary>
<tertiary>description></tertiary></indexterm>
which divides and returns the integer part, and
remainder (<computeroutput>//</computeroutput>), which
divides and returns the remainder. For examples of the arithmetic operators,
see <xref linkend="aropxmp" />.</para>
<para>The result of an arithmetic operation is formatted as a character string
according to specific rules. The most important rules are: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Results are calculated up to a maximum number of significant
digits. The default is <computeroutput>9</computeroutput>, but can be overridden
on a source-file basis with the <xref linkend="optionsd" xrefstyle="select:title"/> directive.
The default setting can be altered with the NUMERIC DIGITS instruction.
<indexterm><primary>DIGITS option of NUMERIC instruction</primary></indexterm>
Thus, with NUMERIC DIGITS 9, if a result requires more than 9 digits, it is rounded to 9 digits.
For example, the division of 2 by 3 results in 0.666666667.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Except for division and power, trailing zeros are preserved.
For example:
<example>
<title>Arithmetic</title>
<programlisting>
2.40 + 2    ->    4.40
2.40 - 2    ->    0.40
2.40 * 2    ->    4.80
2.40 / 2    ->    1.2
</programlisting>
</example>
If necessary, you can remove trailing zeros with the
<classname>String</classname> <xref linkend="mthStringStrip" xrefstyle="select:title"/>
method, the
<xref linkend="bifStrip" xrefstyle="select:title"/> built-in function,
or by division by 1.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A zero result is always expressed as the single digit
<computeroutput>0</computeroutput>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Exponential form is used for a result depending on its value
and the setting of NUMERIC DIGITS.
If the number of places needed
before the decimal point exceeds the NUMERIC DIGITS setting, or the number
of places after the point exceeds twice the NUMERIC DIGITS setting, the number
is expressed in exponential notation:
<example>
<title>Arithmetic</title>
<programlisting>
1e6 * 1e6    ->    1E+12           /* not 1000000000000 */
1 / 3E10     ->    3.33333333E-11  /* not 0.0000000000333333333 */
</programlisting>
</example>
</para></listitem></itemizedlist>

<section id="prec"><title>Precision</title>
<indexterm><primary>arithmetic</primary>
<secondary>precision</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>significant digits in arithmetic</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>DIGITS subkeyword</primary>
<secondary>in a NUMERIC instruction</secondary></indexterm>
<para>Precision is the maximum number of significant digits that can result
from an operation. This is controlled by the instruction:
<mediaobject><imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/number_digits.svg" scale="55" />
</imageobject></mediaobject>
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis role="italic">expression</emphasis> is evaluated and must result in a positive
whole number. This defines the precision (number of significant digits) of
a calculation.  Results are rounded to that precision, if necessary.</para>
<para>If you do not specify <emphasis role="italic">expression</emphasis>
in this instruction, or if no
NUMERIC DIGITS instruction has been processed since the start of a program,
the default precision is used. The Rexx standard for the default precision
is <computeroutput>9</computeroutput>.  The default may be overridden on a
source-file basis using the <xref linkend="optionsd" xrefstyle="select:title"/> directive.
</para>
<para>NUMERIC DIGITS can set values smaller than nine. However, use small
values with care because the loss of precision and rounding affects all Rexx
computations, including, for example, the computation of new values for the
control variable in DO loops.</para>

<indexterm><primary>+ (addition operator)</primary></indexterm>
<computeroutput>-</computeroutput>,
<indexterm><primary>- (subtraction operator)</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>// (remainder operator)</primary></indexterm>
<computeroutput>**</computeroutput>
<indexterm><primary>** (power operator)</primary></indexterm>
(add, subtract, multiply, divide, integer divide, remainder, and power).</para>
<para>Before every arithmetic operation, the terms operated upon have leading
zeros removed (noting the position of any decimal point, and leaving only
one zero if all the digits in the number are zeros). They are then truncated,
if necessary, to DIGITS + 1 significant digits before being used in the
computation. The extra digit improves accuracy because it is inspected at the
end of an operation, when a number is rounded to the required precision. When
a number is truncated, the LOSTDIGITS condition is raised if a SIGNAL ON LOSTDIGITS
condition trap is active. The operation is then carried out under up to double
that precision. When the operation is completed, the result is rounded, if
necessary, to the precision specified by the NUMERIC DIGITS instruction.</para>
<para>The values are rounded as follows: 5 through 9 are rounded up, and 0
through 4 are rounded down.</para>

<section id="power"><title>Power</title>
<indexterm><primary>absolute value</primary>
<secondary>used with power</secondary></indexterm>
<para>The ** (power) operator
raises a number to a power, which can be positive, negative, or
<computeroutput>0</computeroutput>. The power must be a whole number.
The second term in the operation must be a whole number and is rounded to
DIGITS digits, if necessary, as described in
<xref linkend="nudbr" />.
If negative, the absolute value of the power is
used, and the result is inverted (that is, the number 1 is divided by the
result). For calculating the power, the number is multiplied by itself for
the number of times expressed by the power. Trailing zeros are then removed
as though the result were divided by 1.</para>
</section>

<section id="intedivis"><title>Integer Division</title>
<indexterm><primary>integer</primary>
<secondary>division</secondary>
<tertiary>description></tertiary></indexterm>
<para>The % (integer divide) operator divides two numbers
and returns the integer part of the result.  The result is calculated by
repeatedly subtracting the divisor from the dividend as long as the dividend is
larger than the divisor. During this subtraction, the absolute values of both
the dividend and the divisor are used: the sign of the final result is the same
as that which would result from regular division.</para>
<para>If the result cannot be expressed as a whole number, the operation is in
error and fails&mdash;that is, the result must not have more digits than the
current setting of NUMERIC DIGITS. For example,
<computeroutput>10000000000%3</computeroutput> requires
10 digits for the result (3333333333) and would, therefore, fail if
<computeroutput>NUMERIC DIGITS 9</computeroutput> were in effect.</para>
</section>

<section id="remainder"><title>Remainder</title>
<indexterm><primary>remainder</primary>
<secondary>description></secondary></indexterm>
<para>The // (remainder) operator returns the remainder
from an integer division and is defined to be the residue of the dividend
after integer division.  The sign of the remainder, if nonzero, is the same
as that of the original dividend.</para>
<para>This operation fails under the same conditions as integer division, that
is, if integer division on the same two terms fails, the remainder cannot
be calculated.</para>

<para>For both large and small numbers, an exponential notation can be useful.
For example: </para>
<programlisting>
numeric digits 5
say 54321*54321
</programlisting>
<para>would display <computeroutput>2950800000</computeroutput> in the long
form. Because this is misleading, the result is expressed as
<computeroutput>2.9508E+9</computeroutput> instead.</para>
<para>The definition of numbers is, therefore, extended as follows:
<mediaobject><imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/number_exponential.svg" scale="55" />
</imageobject></mediaobject>
</para>

<para>The integer following the <computeroutput>E</computeroutput>
represents a power of ten that is to be applied to the number. The
<computeroutput>E</computeroutput> can be in uppercase or lowercase.</para>
<para>Certain character strings are numbers even though they do not appear to
be numeric, such as <computeroutput>0E123</computeroutput> (0 times 10 raised to the
power of 123) and <computeroutput>1E342</computeroutput> (1 times 10 raised to the
power of 342).  Also, a comparison such as
<computeroutput>0E123=0E567</computeroutput> gives a true result of
<computeroutput>1</computeroutput> (0 is equal to 0).
To prevent problems when comparing nonnumeric strings, use the strict
comparison operators.</para>

<para>The results of calculations are returned in either conventional or
exponential form, depending on the setting of
<indexterm><primary>NUMERIC instruction</primary>
<secondary>FORM option</secondary></indexterm>
NUMERIC DIGITS. If the number of places
needed before the decimal point exceeds DIGITS, or the number of places after
the point exceeds twice DIGITS, the exponential form is used. The exponential
form the language processor generates always has a sign following the
<computeroutput>E</computeroutput> to improve readability. If the exponent is
<computeroutput>0</computeroutput>, the exponential
part is omitted&mdash;that is, an exponential part of
<computeroutput>E+0</computeroutput> is not
generated.</para>
<para>You can explicitly convert numbers to exponential form, or force them to
be displayed in the long form, by using the
<xref linkend="bifFormat" xrefstyle="select:title"/> built-in function.
</para>
<para>Scientific
notation is a form of exponential notation that adjusts the power of
ten so that the number contains only one nonzero digit before the decimal
point. Engineering notation is a form of exponential
notation in which up to three digits appear before the decimal point, and
the power of ten is always a multiple of three. The integer part can, therefore,
range from <computeroutput>1</computeroutput> through
<computeroutput>999</computeroutput>. You can control whether scientific
or engineering notation
<indexterm><primary>engineering notation</primary></indexterm>
is used with the following instruction:

a result exceeds the range that the language processor can handle, when the
result is formatted according to the current settings of NUMERIC DIGITS and
NUMERIC FORM.  The language defines a minimum capability for the exponential
part, namely the largest number that can be expressed as an exact integer
in default precision. Because the default precision is
<computeroutput>9</computeroutput>, you can
use exponents in the range <computeroutput>-999999999</computeroutput> through
<computeroutput>999999999</computeroutput>.
</para>
<para>Because this allows for (very) large exponents, overflow or underflow
is treated as a syntax error.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Insufficient storage.</para>
<para>Storage is needed for calculations and intermediate
results, and if an arithmetic operation fails because of lack of storage.
This is considered as a terminating error.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
