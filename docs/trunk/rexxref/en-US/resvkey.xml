<chapter id="resvkey"><title>Reserved Keywords</title>
<indexterm><primary>keyword</primary>
<secondary>conflict with commands</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>keyword</primary>
<secondary>reservation of</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>reservation of keywords</primary></indexterm>
<para>Keywords can be used as ordinary symbols in many unambiguous situations.
 The precise rules are given in this chapter.</para>
<para>  The free syntax of Rexx implies that some symbols are reserved for use
by the language processor in certain contexts.</para>
<para>Within particular instructions, some symbols can be reserved to separate
the parts of the instruction. These symbols are referred to as keywords.
Examples of Rexx keywords are the WHILE keyword in a DO instruction and the
THEN keyword, which acts as a clause terminator in this case, following an
IF or WHEN clause.</para>
<para>Apart from these cases, only simple symbols that are the first token in
a clause and that are not followed by an &quot;=&quot; or &quot;:&quot; are
checked to see if they are instruction keywords. The symbols can be freely
used elsewhere in clauses without being understood as keywords.</para>
<para>Be careful with host commands or subcommands with the same
name as Rexx keywords. To avoid problems, enclose at least the command or
subcommand in quotation marks. For example:</para>
<programlisting>
"DELETE" Fn"."Ext
</programlisting>
<indexterm><primary>NOVALUE condition</primary>
<secondary>use of</secondary></indexterm>
<para>You can then also use the SIGNAL ON NOVALUE condition to check the
integrity of an executable.</para>
<para>Alternatively, you can precede such command strings with two
adjacent quotation marks to concatenate the null string to the beginning.
For example:</para>
<programlisting>
""Erase Fn"."Ext
</programlisting>
<para>A third option is to enclose the entire expression, or the
first symbol, in parentheses. For example:</para>
<programlisting>(Erase Fn"."Ext)
</programlisting>
