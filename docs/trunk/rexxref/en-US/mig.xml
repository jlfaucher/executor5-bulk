<appendix id="mig"><title>Migration</title>
<para>This appendix lists some differences between Open Object Rexx 5.0
and earlier versions of Open Object Rexx.</para>

<section id="changed"><title>Incompatible ooRexx features</title>
<para>Functions or features which have been changed in ooRexx 5.0 in a way
that will lead to incompatibilities with prior versions.
</para>

<section id="changed.systempfilename"><title>RexxUtil SysTempFileName</title>
<para><xref linkend="utlSystempfilename" xrefstyle="select:title"/>
on Unix-like platforms now behaves identically to SysTempFileName on Windows.
It no longer uses only the first five characters of the file name part of the
template, appending a random string to make it unique.
It also no more prepends an operating system-chosen writable path if no path
is given in the template.
Instead it now uses the same filler-based mechanism as the Windows version
does.
</para>
<para>Existing ooRexx programs using SysTempFileName on Unix-like
platforms will need to be amended.
</para>
</section>

</section>


<section id="deprecated"><title>Deprecated Rexx features</title>
<para>In exceptional circumstances, ooRexx may deprecate functions or features,
which means the use of these functions is discouraged, documentation is no
longer provided, and bug reports against deprecated functions will not be
accepted.
Reasons for deprecation include broken functionality, features that were
never officially documented, or functions no longer required.
</para>
<para>Although existing code using deprecated functions is expected to continue
to work as-is, you are strongly encouraged to migrate to the replacement
functionality, as these functions may be removed from future releases of the
interpreter.
</para>

<section id="deprecated.semaphore"><title>RexxUtil Semaphore functions</title>
<para>The following RexxUtil functions related to
semaphore-processing have been deprecated.
<simplelist columns="2">
 <member>SysCloseEventSem</member>
 <member>SysCloseMutexSem</member>
 <member>SysCreateEventSem</member>
 <member>SysCreateMutexSem</member>
 <member>SysOpenEventSem</member>
 <member>SysOpenMutexSem</member>
 <member>SysPostEventSem</member>
 <member>SysPulseEventSem</member>
 <member>SysReleaseMutexSem</member>
 <member>SysRequestMutexSem</member>
 <member>SysResetEventSem</member>
 <member>SysWaitEventSem</member>
</simplelist>
</para>
<para>They have been superseded by the new
<xref linkend="ooRexxEventSemaphoreClass" xrefstyle="select:title"/> and
<xref linkend="ooRexxMutexSemaphoreClass" xrefstyle="select:title"/>.
</para>
</section>

<section id="deprecated.loaddrop"><title>RexxUtil SysLoadFuncs/SysDropFuncs</title>
<para>The RexxUtil functions SysLoadFuncs and SysDropFuncs have been deprecated.
Since ooRexx 4.0.0 these functions do nothing.
</para>
</section>

<section id="deprecated.options"><title>::OPTIONS NOVALUE ERROR directive</title>
<para>The ::OPTIONS NOVALUE ERROR directive has been deprecated.
It was renamed to <xref linkend="optionsd" xrefstyle="select:title"/>
NOVALUE SYNTAX.
</para>
</section>

<section id="deprecated.argutil"><title>Class ArgUtil</title>
<para>The ArgUtil class and all of it methods have been deprecated.
It has been superseded by <xref linkend="clsValidate" xrefstyle="select:title"/>.
</para>
