<para>The error numbers produced by syntax errors during the processing of Rexx
programs are all in the range 1 to 99. Errors are raised in response to conditions,
for example, SYNTAX, NOMETHOD, and PROPAGATE. When the condition is SYNTAX,
the value of the error number is placed in the variable RC when SIGNAL ON
SYNTAX is trapped.</para>
<indexterm><primary>error</primary>
<secondary>messages</secondary>
<tertiary>retrieving with ERRORTEXT</tertiary></indexterm>
<para>You can use the ERRORTEXT built-in function to return the text of an error
message.</para>
<para>Some errors have associated subcodes. A subcode is a one- to three-digit
decimal extension to the error number, for example,
<computeroutput>911</computeroutput> in <computeroutput>19.911</computeroutput>.
When an error subcode is available, additional information that
further defines the source of the error is given. The ERRORTEXT built-in function
cannot retrieve the secondary message, but it is available from the condition
object created when SIGNAL ON SYNTAX traps an error.
</para>
<para>Note that some of below listed error messages may not actually be used by the
interpreter, but are being retained for compatibility with existing Rexx code or libraries.
