<preface id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>This book describes the Open Object Rexx Interpreter, called the
<emphasis role="italic">interpreter</emphasis> or
<emphasis role="italic">language processor</emphasis> in the
following, and the object-oriented Rexx language.</para>
<para>This book is intended for people who plan to develop applications using
Rexx. Its users range from the novice, who might have experience in some
programming language but no Rexx experience, to the experienced application
developer, who might have had some experience with Object Rexx.</para>
<para>This book is a reference rather than a tutorial. It assumes you are
already familiar with object-oriented programming concepts.</para>
<para>Descriptions include the use and syntax of the language and explain how
the language processor &quot;interprets&quot; the language as a program is
running.</para>

<para>Throughout this book, syntax is described using the structure defined
below.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Read the syntax diagrams from left to right, from top to bottom, following
the path of the line.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>&gt;&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol
indicates the beginning of a statement.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>---&gt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates that the
statement syntax is continued on the next line.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol indicates
that a statement is continued from the previous line.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>---&gt;&lt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates the end
of a statement.</para>
<para>Diagrams of syntactical units other than complete statements start
with the  <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol and end with
the  <computeroutput>---&gt;</computeroutput> symbol.</para></listitem>

vertically, in a stack. If you must choose one of the items, one
item of the stack appears on the main path.</para>

<listitem><para>Language keywords appear in uppercase (for example,
<computeroutput>SAY</computeroutput>). They must
be spelled exactly as shown but you can type them in upper, lower, or mixed
case. Variables appear in all lowercase letters (for example,
<computeroutput>parmx</computeroutput>). They represent user-supplied names
or values.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Class and method names appear in mixed case (for example,
<computeroutput>.Object~new</computeroutput>). They must

<listitem><para>If punctuation marks, parentheses, arithmetic operators, or
such symbols are shown, you must enter them as part of the syntax.
