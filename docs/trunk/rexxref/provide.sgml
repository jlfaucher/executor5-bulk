<chapter id="provide"><title>Objects and Classes</title>
<indexterm><primary>object method</primary></indexterm>
<para>This chapter provides an overview of the Rexx class structure.</para>
<para>A Rexx object consists of object methods
<indexterm><primary>class methods</primary></indexterm>
and object variables. Sending
a message to an object causes the object to perform some action; a method
whose name matches the message name defines the action that is performed.
Only an object's methods can access the object variables belonging to
an object. EXPOSE instructions within an object's methods specify object
variables. Any variables not exposed are dropped on return from a method.</para>
<para>You can create
an object by sending a message to a class object. An object created from a
class is an <emphasis>instance</emphasis> of that class. Classes define
the methods and method names for their instances. The methods a class defines
for its instances are called the <emphasis>instance methods</emphasis>
<indexterm><primary>instance methods</primary></indexterm>
of that class. These are the object methods for the instances. Classes can also
define <emphasis>class methods</emphasis>, which are a class's own
object methods.</para>

<note><title>Note</title>
<para>When referring to object methods (for objects
other than classes) or instance methods (for classes), this book uses the
term <emphasis>methods</emphasis> when the meaning is clear from the context.
When referring to object methods and class methods of classes, this book uses
the qualified terms to avoid possible confusion.</para></note>

<section id="typcla"><title>Types of Classes</title>
<para>There are three kinds of classes: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Object classes</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Mixin classes</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Abstract classes</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
<para> The following sections explain these.</para>

<section id="objcla"><title>Object Classes</title>
<indexterm><primary>object classes</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>class</primary>
<secondary>types</secondary>
<tertiary>object</tertiary></indexterm>
<para>An <emphasis>object class</emphasis> is like a factory
for producing objects. An object class creates objects (instances) and provides
methods that these objects can use. An object acquires the instance methods
of the class to which it belongs at the time of its creation. If a class gains
additional methods, objects created before the definition of these methods
do not acquire these methods.</para>
<para>Because the object methods also define the object variables, object
classes are factories for creating Rexx objects. The Array class (see
<link linkend="clsArray">The Array Class</link>)
is an example of an object class.</para>
</section>

<section id="xmixin"><title>Mixin Classes</title>
<indexterm><primary>mixin classes</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>class</primary>
<secondary>types</secondary>
<tertiary>mixin</tertiary></indexterm>
<para>Classes can inherit from more than the single superclass from
which they were created. This is called
<emphasis>multiple inheritance</emphasis>. Classes designed
to add a set of instance and class
methods to other classes are called <emphasis>mixin classes</emphasis>,
or simply mixins.</para>
<para>You can add mixin methods to an existing class by sending an INHERIT
message or using the INHERIT option on the ::CLASS directive. (See
<link linkend="dire">Directives</link>.)
In either case, the class to be inherited must be a mixin. During both class
creation and multiple inheritance, subclasses inherit both class and instance
methods from their superclasses.</para>
<para>Mixins are always associated
<indexterm><primary>base class for mixins</primary></indexterm>
with a <emphasis>base class</emphasis>, which is the mixin's first non-mixin
superclass. Any subclass of the mixin's base class can (directly or indirectly)
inherit a mixin; other classes cannot.</para>
<para>To create a new mixin class, you send a MIXINCLASS message to an existing
class or use the ::CLASS directive with the MIXINCLASS option. A mixin class
is also an object class and can create instances of the class.</para>
</section>

<section id="abscla"><title>Abstract Classes</title>
<indexterm><primary>abstract class, definition</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>class</primary>
<secondary>types</secondary>
<tertiary>abstract</tertiary></indexterm>
<para><emphasis>Abstract classes</emphasis> provide definitions for instance
methods and class methods
but are not intended to create instances. Abstract classes often define the
message interfaces that subclasses should implement.</para>
<para>You create an abstract class like object or mixin classes. No extra
messages or keywords on the ::CLASS directive are necessary. Rexx does not
prevent users from creating instances of abstract classes.</para>

<section id="xmetac"><title>Metaclasses</title>
<indexterm><primary>metaclasses</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>class</primary>
<secondary>types</secondary>
<tertiary>metaclass</tertiary></indexterm>
<para>A <emphasis>metaclass</emphasis> is a class you
can use to create another class. The only metaclass that Rexx provides is
.class, the Class class. The Class class is the metaclass of all the classes
Rexx provides. This means that instances of .class are themselves classes.
The Class class is like a factory for producing the factories that produce
objects.</para>
<para>To change the behavior of an object that is an instance, you generally
use subclassing. For example, you can create Statarray, a subclass of the
Array class (see <link linkend="clsArray">The Array Class</link>).
The Statarray class can include a
method for computing a total of all the numeric elements of an array.</para>
<programlisting>
/* Creating an array subclass for statistics */

::class statarray subclass array public

::method init    /*  Initialize running total and forward to superclass */
expose total
total = 0
/* <link linkend="mthMessageNew">init</link>  describes the init method.  */
forward class (super)

::method put     /*  Modify to increment running total */
expose total
use arg value
total = total + value  /* Should verify that value is numeric!!! */
forward class (super)

::method "[]="   /*  Modify to increment running total */
forward message "PUT"

::method remove  /*  Modify to decrement running total */
expose total
use arg index
forward message "AT" continue
total = total - result
forward class (super)

::method average /*  Return the average of the array elements */
expose total
return total / self~items

::method total   /*  Return the running total of the array elements */
expose total
return total
</programlisting>
<para>You can use this method on the individual array
<emphasis>instances</emphasis>, so it is an
<emphasis>instance method</emphasis>.</para>
<para>However, if you want to change the behavior of the factory producing the
arrays, you need a new class method. One way to do
this is to use the ::METHOD directive with the CLASS option. Another way to
add a <emphasis>class</emphasis> method is to create a new metaclass that
changes the behavior
of the Statarray class. A new metaclass is a subclass of .class.</para>
<para>You can use a metaclass by specifying it in a SUBCLASS or MIXINCLASS
message or on a ::CLASS directive with the METACLASS option.</para>
<para>If you are adding a highly specialized class method useful only for a
particular class, use the ::METHOD directive with the CLASS option. However,
if you are adding a class method that would be useful for many classes, such
as an instance counter that counts how many instances a class creates,
you use a metaclass.</para>
<para>The following examples add a class method that keeps a running total of
instances created. The first version uses the ::METHOD directive with the
CLASS option. The second version uses a metaclass.</para>
<para>Version 1</para>

</section>
</section>

<section id="xcremet"><title>Creating Classes and Methods</title>
<para>You can define a class using either directives or messages.</para>
<para>To define a class using directives, you place a ::CLASS directive at the
end of your source program:</para>
<programlisting>
::class "Account"
</programlisting>
<para>This creates an Account class that is a subclass of the Object class.
(See <link linkend="clsObject">The Object Class</link> for a description of the
Object class.)  The string &quot;Account&quot;
is a string identifier for the new class.</para>
<para>Now you can use ::METHOD directives to add methods to your new class. The
::METHOD directives must immediately follow the ::CLASS directive that creates
the class. </para>
<programlisting>
::method type
return "an account"

::method "name="
expose name
use arg name

::method name
expose name
return name
</programlisting>
<para>This adds the methods TYPE, NAME, and NAME= to the Account class.</para>
<para>You can create a subclass of the Account class and define a method for
it: </para>
<programlisting>
::class "Savings" subclass account
::method type
return "a savings account"
</programlisting>
<para>Now you can create an instance of the Savings class with the NEW method
(see <link linkend="mthClassNew">NEW</link>) and send TYPE, NAME, and NAME= messages
to that instance:</para>
<programlisting>
asav = .savings~new
say asav~type
asav~name = "John Smith"
</programlisting>
<para>The Account class methods NAME and NAME= create a pair of access methods
to the account object variable NAME. The following directive sequence creates
the NAME and NAME= methods: </para>
<programlisting>
::method "name="
expose name
use arg name

::method name
expose name
return name
</programlisting>

<para>You can replace this with a single ::METHOD directive with
the ATTRIBUTE option. For example, the directive </para>
<programlisting>
::method name attribute
</programlisting>
<para>adds two methods, NAME and NAME= to a class. These methods perform the
same function as the NAME and NAME= methods in the original example. The NAME
method returns the current value of the object variable NAME; the NAME= method
assigns a new value to the object variable NAME.</para>
</section>

<section id="usingcl"><title>Using Classes</title>
<para>When you create a new class, it is always a subclass of an existing class.
You can create new classes with the ::CLASS directive or by sending the SUBCLASS
or MIXINCLASS message to an existing class. If you specify neither the SUBCLASS
nor the MIXINCLASS option on the ::CLASS directive, the superclass for the
new class is the Object class, and it is not a mixin class.</para>
<para>Example of creating a new class using a message: </para>
<programlisting>
persistence = .object~mixinclass("Persistence")
myarray=.array~subclass("myarray")~~inherit(persistence)
</programlisting>
<para>Example of creating a new class using the directive:</para>
<programlisting>
::class persistence mixinclass object
::class myarray subclass array inherit persistence
</programlisting>
</section>

<section id="xscope"><title>Scope</title>
<indexterm><primary>method</primary>
<secondary>scope</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>scope</primary>
<secondary>description</secondary></indexterm>
<para>A <emphasis>scope</emphasis> is the methods
and object variables defined in a single class. Only methods defined in a
particular scope can access object variables within that scope. This means
that object variables in a subclass can have the same names as object variables
in a superclass, because the object variables are at different scopes.</para>
</section>

<section id="usesem">
<title>Defining Instance Methods with SETMETHOD or ENHANCED</title>
<para>In Rexx, methods are usually associated with instances using classes, but
it is also possible to add methods directly to an instance using the SETMETHOD
(see <link linkend="mthObjectSetMethod">SETMETHOD</link>) or ENHANCED (see
<link linkend="mthClassEnhanced">ENHANCED</link>) method.</para>
<para>All subclasses of the Object class inherit SETMETHOD. You can use
SETMETHOD to create one-off objects, objects that must be absolutely
unique so that a class that is capable of creating other instances is not
necessary. The Class class also provides an ENHANCED method that lets you
create new instances of a class with additional methods. The methods and the
object variables defined on an object with SETMETHOD or ENHANCED form a separate
scope, like the scopes the class hierarchy defines.</para>
</section>

<section id="methna"><title>Method Names</title>
<para>A method
name can be any string. When an object receives a message, the language processor
searches for a method whose name matches the message name in uppercase.</para>

<note><title>Note</title>
<para>The language processor also translates the specified name of all
methods added to objects into uppercase characters.</para></note>
<para>You must surround a method name with quotation marks when it contains
characters that are not allowed in a symbol (for example, the operator
characters). The following example creates a new class (the Cost class),
defines a new method (%), creates an instance of the Cost class (mycost),
and sends a <computeroutput>%</computeroutput> message
to <computeroutput>mycost</computeroutput>: </para>

<programlisting>
cost=.object~subclass("A cost")
cost~define("%", &apos;expose p; say "Enter a price."; pull p; say p*1.07;&apos;)
mycost=cost~new
mycost~"%"        /* Produces:  Enter a price.             */
                  /* If the user specifies a price of 100, */
                  /* produces: 107.00                      */

<para>The search order for a method name matching the message is for: </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>A method the object itself defines with SETMETHOD or ENHANCED.
(See <link linkend="mthObjectSetMethod">SETMETHOD</link> .)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A method the object's class defines. (Note that an object
acquires the instance methods of the class to which it belongs at the time of
its creation. If a class gains additional methods, objects created before the
definition of these methods do not acquire these methods.)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A method that a superclass of the object's class defines.
This is also limited to methods that were available when the object was
created. The order of the INHERIT (see
<link linkend="mthClassInherit">INHERIT</link>) messages sent to an object's
class determines the search order of the superclass method definitions.
</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<para>This search order places methods of a class before methods of its
superclasses so that a class can supplement or override inherited methods.
</para>
<para>If the language processor does not find a match for the message name, the
language processor checks the object for a method name UNKNOWN. If it exists,
the language processor calls the UNKNOWN method and returns as the message
result any result the UNKNOWN method returns. The UNKNOWN method arguments
are the original message name and a Rexx array containing the original message
arguments.</para>
<para>If the object does not have an UNKNOWN method, the language processor
raises a NOMETHOD condition.</para>
</section>

<section id="unkno"><title>Defining an UNKNOWN Method</title>
<para>When an object that receives a message does not have a matching message
name, the language processor checks if the object has a method named UNKNOWN.
If the object has an UNKNOWN method, the language processor calls UNKNOWN,
passing two arguments. The first argument is the name of the method that was
not located. The second argument is an array containing the arguments passed
with the original message.</para>
<para>If you define an UNKNOWN method, you can use the following syntax:</para>

<para>You can change the usual search order for methods by: </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Ensuring that the receiver object is the sender object.
(You usually do this by specifying the special variable SELF--see
<link linkend="xself">SELF</link>.)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Specifying a colon and a class symbol after the message name.
The class symbol can be a variable name or an environment symbol. It identifies
the class object to be used as the starting point for the method search.</para>
<para>The class object must be a superclass of the class defining the active
method, or, if you used SETMETHOD to define the active method, the object's own
class. The class symbol is usually the special variable SUPER
(see <link linkend="xsuper">SUPER</link>) but it can be any environment
symbol or variable name whose value is a valid class.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>Suppose you create an Account class that is a subclass of the Object
class, define a TYPE method for the Account class, and create the Savings class
that is a subclass of Account. You could define a TYPE method for the Savings
class as follows: </para>
<programlisting>
savings~define("TYPE", &apos;return "a savings account"&apos;)
</programlisting>
<para>You could change the search order by using the following line: </para>
<programlisting>
savings~define("TYPE", &apos;return self~type:super "(savings)"&apos;)
</programlisting>
<para>This changes the search order so that the language processor searches for
the TYPE method first in the Account superclass (rather than in the Savings
subclass). When you create an instance of the Savings class
(<computeroutput>asav</computeroutput>)
and send a TYPE message to <computeroutput>asav</computeroutput>:</para>
<programlisting>
say asav~type
</programlisting>
<para><computeroutput>an account (savings)</computeroutput> is displayed.
The TYPE method of the Savings class calls the TYPE method of the Account
class, and adds the string <computeroutput>(savings)</computeroutput> to the
results.</para>

<para>A method can be public or private.
Any object can send a message that runs a <emphasis>public</emphasis> method.
A <emphasis>private</emphasis> method runs only when an object sends a
message to itself (that is, using the variable SELF as the message receiver).
Private methods include methods at different scopes within the same object.
(Superclasses can make private methods available to their subclasses while
hiding those methods from other objects.) A private method is like an internal
subroutine. It provides common functions to the object methods but is hidden
from other programs.</para>

<section id="obdes"><title>Object Destruction and Uninitialization</title>
<para>Object destruction is implicit. When an object is no longer in use, Rexx
automatically reclaims its storage. If the object has allocated other system
resources, you must release them at this time. (Rexx cannot release these
resources, because it is unaware that the object has allocated them.)</para>
<para>Similarly, other uninitialization processing may be needed, for example,
by a message object holding an unreported error. An object requiring
uninitialization
should define an UNINIT method. If this method is defined, Rexx runs it before
reclaiming the object's storage. If an object has more than one UNINIT method
(defined in several classes), each UNINIT method is responsible for sending
the UNINIT method up the object hierarchy.</para>

<para>If you supply an object other than a string in these contexts, by default
the language processor converts it to some string representation and uses
this. However, the programmer can cause the language processor to raise the
NOSTRING condition when the supplied object does not have an equivalent string
value.</para>
<para>To obtain a string value, the language processor sends a REQUEST("STRING")
message to the object. Strings and other objects that have string values return
the appropriate string value for Rexx to use. (This happens automatically
for strings and for subclasses of the String class because they inherit a
suitable MAKESTRING method from the String class.) For this mechanism to work
correctly, you must provide a MAKESTRING method for any other objects with
string values.</para>
<para>For other objects without string values (that is, without a MAKESTRING
method), the action taken depends on the setting of the NOSTRING condition
trap. If the NOSTRING condition is being trapped (see
<link linkend="condtra">Conditions and Condition Traps</link>),
the language processor raises the NOSTRING condition. If the NOSTRING condition
is not being trapped, the language processor sends a STRING message to the
object to obtain its readable string representation (see the STRING method
of the Object class <link linkend="mthObjectString">STRING</link>) and uses this string.
</para>
<para>When comparing a string object with the .nil object, if
the NOSTRING condition is being trapped, then</para>
<programlisting>
if string = .nil
</programlisting>
<para>will raise the NOSTRING condition, whereas</para>
<programlisting>
if .nil = string
</programlisting>
<para>will not as the .nil objects "=" method does not expect
a string as an argument.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
d = .directory~new
say substr(d,5,7)         /* Produces "rectory" from "a Directory" */
signal on nostring
say substr(d,5,7)         /* Raises the NOSTRING condition */
say substr(d~string,3,6)  /* Displays "Direct" */
</programlisting>
<para>For arguments to Rexx object methods, different rules apply. When a
method expects a string as an argument, the argument object is sent the
REQUEST("STRING") message. If REQUEST returns the NIL object, then the
method raises an error.</para>

<para>The chapters that follow describe the classes and other objects that Rexx
provides and their available methods. Rexx provides the objects listed in
these sections and they are generally available to all methods through
environment symbols (see <link linkend="ensym">Environment Symbols</link>).

<listitem><para>In the method descriptions in the chapters that follow, methods
that return a result begin with the word "returns".</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For [] and []= methods, the syntax diagrams include
the index or indexes within the brackets. These diagrams are intended to show
how you can use these methods. For example, to retrieve the first element
of a one-dimensional array named Array1, you would typically use the syntax:
<programlisting>
Array1[1]
</programlisting>
rather than:
<programlisting>
Array1~&quot;[]&quot;(1)
</programlisting>
even though the latter is valid and equivalent. For more information,
see <link linkend="mssg">Message Terms</link> and
<link linkend="msgit">Message Instructions</link>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>When the argument of a method must be a specific kind of object (such
as array, class, method, or string) the variable you specify must be of the
same class as the required object or be able to produce an object of the
required kind in response to a conversion message. In particular, subclasses
are acceptable in place of superclasses (unless overridden in a way that
changes superclass behavior), because they inherit a suitable conversion method
from their Rexx superclass.</para>
<para>The REQUEST method of the Object class (see
<link linkend="mthObjectRequest">request</link>)
can perform this validation.</para></listitem>
