<section id="deprecatedBaseClasses"><title>Deprecated Base Classes</title>
<indexterm><primary>Deprecated</primary><secondary>base and mixin classes</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  All <link linkend="ovvDeprecated">deprecated</link> base and mixin classes are listed in this section. In general, the
  deprecated classes are simply not needed anymore, and the programmer need do nothing to replace them.
</para>

<section><title>AdvancedControls Mixin Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>Deprecated</primary><secondary>AdvancedControls Mixin Class</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  This class is <link linkend="ovvDeprecated">deprecated</link>. The ooDialog framework <link
  linkend="sctHistory">no longer</link> makes a distinction between some types of dialog controls, and how to use the
  controls. I.e., the programmer no longer needs to inherit a special class to use some of the dialog controls. All the
  methods of the AdvancedControls have been moved into the appropriate dialog class. Therefore the programmer does not
  need to do anything to use any dialog control in any dialog. In new code simply omit inheriting AdvancedControls. In
  old code, <emphasis role="italic">inherit AdvancedContorls</emphasis> can be deleted from any dialog class declaration
  and the program will behave the same.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>MessageExtensions Mixin Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>Deprecated</primary><secondary>MessageExtensions Mixin Class</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  This class is <link linkend="ovvDeprecated">deprecated</link>. The MessageExtensions class has been renamed to the
  <link linkend="clsEventNotification">EventNotification</link> class. In addition, the EventNotification class is
  inherited by the <link linkend="chpDialogObject">dialog object</link> so that the programmer need do nothing special
  to use event notifications in any dialog. In new code simply omit inheriting MessageExtensions. In old code, <emphasis
  role="italic">inherit MessageExtensions</emphasis> can be deleted from any dialog class declaration and the program
  will behave the same.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>PlainUserDialog Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>Deprecated</primary><secondary>PlainUserDialog Class</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  This class is <link linkend="ovvDeprecated">deprecated</link>. The ooDialog framework <link
  linkend="sctHistory">no longer</link> makes a distinction between a plain user dialog and an <link
  linkend="clsUserDialog">user dialog</link>. Directly subclass the <emphasis role="italic">Userdialog</emphasis>
  instead of the <emphasis role="italic">PlainUserDialog</emphasis>.
