<para>
  Menus are lists of items that specify options for an application.  Groups of related options are usually placed in
  submenus. Clicking a menu item either opens a submenu or causes the application to carry out a command.
</para>
<para>
  Menus are arranged as a hierarchy. A <emphasis role="italic">menu bar</emphasis> is the top of the hiearchy for menus
  attached to an application window.  The menu bar will contain a list of <emphasis role="italic">menus</emphasis>, and
  menus can contain <emphasis role="italic">submenus</emphasis>.  Menu bars are often called <emphasis
  role="italic">top-level</emphasis> menus, while the menus and submenus are also known as
  <emphasis role="italic">pop-up</emphasis> menus.
</para>
<para>
  A menu <emphasis role="italic">item</emphasis> either carries out a command, opens a submenu, or is special type of
  menu item called a <emphasis role="italic">separator</emphasis>.  Menu items that do not open a submenu are called
  <emphasis role="italic">command</emphasis> items or simply commands. Menu items that open a submenu are sometimes
  called <emphasis role="italic">menu names</emphasis>. Separators appear as a horizontal line. They are used to divide
  a menu into groups of related items. A separator cannot be used in a menu bar, and the user cannot select a separator.
</para>
<para>
  Only top-level windows can have menu bars. Child windows can not have a menu bar. If the window has a title bar the
  system positions a menu bar underneath it. All menus must have an owner window.
</para>
<para>
   The system also provides <emphasis role="italic">shortcut menus</emphasis> and the <emphasis
   role="italic">window</emphasis> menu.  A shortcut menu is not attached to a menu bar and can appear anywhere on the
   screen.  Shortcut menus are typically activated by the user right-clicking on a specific portion of the screen and
   the menu items are usually only relevant to what the user clicked on.  For this reason, shortcut menus are often
   called <emphasis role="italic">contetxt</emphasis> menus.  The window menu is also knows as the <emphasis
   role="italic">System</emphasis> menu or the <emphasis role="italic">Control</emphasis> menu.  The  System menu is
   usually managed exclusively by the system.  The user activates the System menu by clicking on the icon in the upper
   left corner of a window, or by right-clicking anywhere on the title bar. Unlike menu bars, child windows can have a
   System menu.  It is unusual for a top-level window to not have a System menu.
</para>
<para>
  The menu related classes in the following table are described in this chapter.  The primary classes that the ooDialog
  programmer will use are the <computeroutput>BinaryMenuBar, UserMenuBar, ScriptMenuBar</computeroutput>, and
  <computeroutput>PopupMenu</computeroutput>. The other classes are mixin classes that implement the functionality
  common to all types of menus. The binary, user, and script menu bar classes all have the same essential functionality.
  They just differ in how they are initially created.  The popup menu class is similar to the menu bar classes, it just
  does not have any methods that are only relevant to a menu bar.

<section id="sctMenuItemIDs"><title>Menu Item IDs</title>
<para>
  Each menu item in a menu can be uniquely identified. This documentation generically refers to a menu item <emphasis
  role="italic">ID</emphasis>, but there are really two ways of identifying a menu item.
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="entMenuItemIdentifier"><term><emphasis role="bold">Menu-Item Identifier</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Each menu item has a unique, non-negative, integer assigned to it by the programmer, called a menu-item identifier.
    These numbers are essentially the same as any other resource <link linkend="defResourceID">ID</link> used in
    ooDialog. The Rexx programmer can use numeric or <link linkend="sctMenuSymbolicID">symbolic</link> IDs for menu-item
    identifier's, in the same way as for other resource IDs.
  </para>
  <para>
    All menus assign menu-item identifiers to command items and submenus. ooDialog uses what the Windows operating
    system calls <emphasis role="italic">extended</emphasis> menus. Extended menus also assign identifiers to
    separators. Identifiers are used for menu command <link linkend="sctMenuCommandEvents">events</link>. In addition, a
    menu item can be specified using its identifier in method invocations. For example, to <link
    linkend="mthEnableClsMenu">enable</link> or <link linkend="mthDisableClsMenu">disable</link> a menu item.
  </para>
  <para>
    Identifiers allow the programmer to specify any menu item anywhere in the menu hiearchy. The <link
    linkend="mthGetIDClsMenu">getID</link>() method can be used to retrieve the identifier of the menu item at a
    specified position
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Menu-Item Position</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    In addition to having a unique identifier, each menu item in a menu bar or menu has a unique position value.
    Although the operating system uses zero-based position numbering, ooDialog uses one-based position numbering to
    conform to general Rexx practice. The leftmost item in a menu bar, or the top item in a menu, has position one. The
    position value is incremented for subsequent menu items. A position value is assigned to all items in a menu,
    including separators.
  </para>
  <para>
    Position values can be used in method invocations that require specifying a menu item. Note that since the top item
    in a menu, or the leftmost menu item in a menu bar, always has a position of one, it is not possible to uniquely
    specify any menu item in a menu hiearchy. Rather, you can only use a position to specify an item in a specific
    submenu.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>
  Except in a few methods where it simply does not make any sense, all menu methods that require specifying a menu item
  accept either a menu item identifier or a menu item position. The menu item specifier is refered to as the menu item
  ID. Since both identifiers and positions are numbers, the programmer needs to specify which is bing used. However, by
  default, the ID is assumed to be an indetifier. Therefore, the programmer only need indicate when the ID is a position
  ID.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sctMenuSymbolicIDs"><title>Symbolic Menu-item IDs</title>
<para>
  Menu-item <link linkend="entMenuItemIdentifier">identifiers</link> are essentially resource <link
  linkend="defResourceID">IDs</link>. The programmer can use symbolic <link linkend="defSymbolicID">IDs</link> for
  menu-item IDs rather than numeric IDs for any menu object method that requires a menu-item ID. However, to do so, the
  programmer <emphasis role="italic">must</emphasis> use the <link linkend=""></link>
</para>
</section>

<section id="sctMenuCommandEvents"><title>Menu Command Events</title>
<indexterm><primary>menu object</primary><secondary>command events</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  Menu items that are not separators and do not open a submenu are called menu command items. When a user selects a
  command item, an <link linkend="ovvEvents">event</link> is generated and the operating system sends a notification to
  the owner window of the menu. The ooDialog framework provides methods to connect this menu command notification to a
  method in the Rexx dialog object in a similar manner to connecting dialog control <link
  linkend="sctConnectingEvents">notifications</link>. The event connection methods are contained within the various menu
  objects and are similar to the event connection methods of the dialog object.
</para>
<para>
  However, there are some specific details when dealing with menus that should be understood. The menu command event is
  connected using the menu item <link linkend="sctMenuItemIDs">identifier</link> of the command item, just as dialog
  control events are connected using the resource ID of the dialog control. Event notifications are always connected to
  a specific Rexx dialog object, the dialog object that represents the <link linkend="ovvUnderlying">underlying</link>
  dialog that the notification is expected to be sent to.
</para>
<para>
  A Rexx dialog control object has one, and only one, underlying dialog. But, a Rexx <link linkend="clsMenuBar">menu bar
  </link> object can be attached to one dialog, then detached and attached to a different dialog. Likewise, the same
  <link linkend="clsPopupMenu">context</link> menu could be used by any number of different dialogs. Because of this, it
  may be necessary to connect a menu command item notification to more than one dialog.
</para>
<para>
  For example, the same context menu object could be used by the programmer in several different dialogs. In this case,
  it is not sufficient to connect each of the menu items once, to one dialog. Rather, the menu items need to be
  connected to each dialog where the context menu is used. When the programmer <link
  linkend="mthShowClsPopupMenu">shows</link> the context menu, it will have one and only one owner dialog. When the user
  selects a menu item, the notification is sent to that owner dialog.
</para>
<para>
  Another example would be a program that shows different dialogs at various times. The dialogs are different, but all
  have a menu bar that contains the same items. One approach would be to create a single menu bar, that is attached to
  each dialog when it is shown. The menu items of the menu bar would then need to be connected to each dialog that the
  menu bar is attached to during the program.
</para>
<para>
  One last point the programmer should be aware of. Both a regular menu item selection and a <link
  linkend="clsButton">button</link> click generate the same event notification. <emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis>
  that a <emphasis role="italic">system</emphasis> menu command event uses a different type of notification than buttons
  or regular menus. A system menu command event notification will never be the same as a button click notification.
</para>
<para>
  Sometimes the action to take when a button is clicked and the action to take when a menu item is selected are the
  same. In these cases, it is a common practice in Windows programming to use the same resource ID for both the button
  and the menu item and then use the same event handler for both the button push and the menu item selection. To use
  this method in ooDialog, the programmer would need to only connect the event once.
</para>
<para>
  E.g., take the case of an OK push button and an Exit menu item. Many times the action to take for both is exactly the
  same. Here the ooDialog programmer would use the same resource ID for both the button and the menu item. OK buttons
  normally use the resource ID of <computeroutput>IDOK</computeroutput>, which the ooDialog framework <link
  linkend="sctStandardEventMethods">automatically</link> connects to the <link linkend="mthOk">OK</link> method. If the
  programmer also uses the IDOK id for the Exit menu item, then nothing else need be done. Whether the user selects the
  Exit menu item, or clicks the OK button, the same method in the Rexx dialog object will be invoked.
</para>
<para>
  Notice that, since a button click and a menu item selection generate the same notification, it is not possible to
  connect a menu item and a button click to separate methods if the they both have the same resource ID. However, in the
  event <link linkend="sctCodingEventHandlers">handling</link> method it is possible to tell whether the event
  originated from the user clicking a button or from selecting a menu item. The first argument to the method will be the
  resource ID of the button or menu item. The second argument will always be 0 if the user selected a menu item and
  non-zero if the user pushed a button. For button controls, the second argument is the window <link
  linkend="defHandle">handle</link> of the button.

<para>
  All the menu classes in ooDialog are similar. Menus have a large number of methods that are common to all types of
  menus. These common methods are contained in the <computeroutput>Menu</computeroutput> class, a mixin class inherited
  by all menu classes. This document treats the menu object in the same way it does the dialog <link
  linkend="chpDialogObject">object</link> and the dialog control <link linkend="chpDialogControlObject">object</link>,
  as an abstract concept. However, in this case the abstract menu object and the <computeroutput>Menu</computeroutput>
  mixin class are essentially the same.
</para>
<para>
  The methods listed in this chapter are all methods of the <computeroutput>Menu</computeroutput> class and all ooDialog
  menus have these methods.

  <listitem>
  <para>
    This example disables the ability of the user to move the position of the dialog at certain times. It does this by
    connecting the system menu's move command event to a method in the Rexx dialog. In the event handler, if the
    position of the dialog is <emphasis role="italic">frozen</emphasis>, then the method returns
    <computeroutput>.true</computeroutput> indicating that the event has been handled by the application.  The operating
    system then takes no further action and the dialog can not be moved by the user.
  </para>
  <para>
    The example is complete and can be copy-pasted into a program file and executed as:

<para>
  A menu bar is often called the top-level menu. It is the bar poisitioned just below the title bar of an application
  window or a dialog. The menu bar object is used, like the <link linkend="clsMenu">menu</link>, <link
  linkend="chpDialogObject">dialog</link>, and dialog <link linkend="chpDialogControlObject">contol</link> objects as an
  abstract concept to document the ooDialog menu objects that represent menu bars. The menu bar classes in ooDialog are
  the <link linkend="clsBinaryMenuBar">BinaryMenuBar</link>, <link linkend="clsUserMenuBar">UserMenuBar</link>, and
  <link linkend="clsScriptMenuBar">ScriptMenuBar</link> classes.
</para>
<para>
  The menu bar object is implemented through the <computeroutput>MenuBar</computeroutput> mixin classs and all menu bars
  have the methods of the <computeroutput>MenuBar</computeroutput> class. Similar to the the menu object, the menu bar
  object is essentially the <computeroutput>MenuBar</computeroutput> mixin class. Note that menu bars <emphasis
  role="italic">are</emphasis> menus. All menu bar objects have all the methods of the <link
  linkend="clsMenu">menu</link> object in addition to the methods specific to the menu bar.

<para>
  Instantiates a new <computeroutput>BinaryMenuBar</computeroutput> object. The menu template can be obtained from a
  compiled binary resource, or an empty binary menu template is constructed in memory.  When an empty template is
  constructed in memory, the programmer can add to the template dynamically using the menu object methods such as <link
  linkend="mthInsertPopup">insertPopup</link>, <link linkend="mthInsertItem">insertItem</link>, etc.. Dynamically
  constructing a menu template in this way is much less error prone than using the <link

        the menu template is limited. The only way to get a menu handle is through the <link

        other ways to get a menu handle.

    In many cases, the <link linkend="mthConnectContextMenu">connectContextMenu</link>() method will be more convenient
