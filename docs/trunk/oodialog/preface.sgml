<chapter id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>
  This book describes the ooDialog framework, which is implemented as an external library package, and part of the Open
  Object Rexx distribution on the <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> platform.  It describes the classes
  in the framework and how to use the framework to program grahical user interfaces, (commonly referred to as a GUI.)
</para>
<para>
  In general, the ooDialog framework simply provides the Rexx programmer with an interface to the Windows API, and
  primarily to the part of the API that deals with dialogs and dialog controls. In almost all cases, the behavior of the
  dialog and its controls is dictated by the Windows API. ooDialog has very little control of this. While this document
  strives to be complete enough that a Rexx programmer, knowing very little of the Windows API, can effectively write
  graphical programs in Rexx, it can never be as comprehensive as the actual Microsoft documentation. Therefore, the
  Rexx programmer that needs, or desires, to go beyond the basic dialog and dialog behavior, will benefit greatly by
  consulting the <link linkend="windowsdoc">MSDN Library</link>.
</para>

<section id="whoshoulduse"><title>Who Should Use This Book</title>
<para>
  This book is intended for Open Object Rexx programmers who want to design graphical user interfaces for their
  applications.
</para>
</section>

<section id="bookstructure"><title>How This Book is Structured</title>
<para>
  This document should be divided into two parts - a tutorial and a reference.  In the original documentation
  accompanying  IBM's Object Rexx, the documentation was in two parts. Unfortunately, the tutorial portion mostly
  described how to use the IBM Resource Workshop.  The Resource Workshop has not been contributed to the open source
  community and is therefore not a part of the Open Object Rexx project. Because the tutorial section was primarily
  directed towards using the Resource Workshop, it does not make much sense in the current context.
</para>
<para>
  This book is primarily a reference that describes the classes and methods in detail.  There is no tutorial. The
  tutorial portion needs to be written (or re-written depending on your point of view.)
</para>
<note><title><emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis></title><para>
  There is no loss of functionality in ooDialog because of the absence of the Resource Workshop.  The Windows resource
  format is well understood and there are any number of free or inexpensive resource editors that do a better job of
  designing dialogs than the Resource Workshop did.  (The Resource Workshop was a 16-bit application with limited
  capacity for the newer features in the Windows user interface.) ooDialog works fine with dialogs designed by any
  modern resource editor.

<section id="syndia"><title>How to Read the Syntax Diagrams</title>
<para>
  Throughout this book, syntax is described using the structure defined below. This is similar to, but slightly
  different than, the IBM syntax diagrams used in other ooRexx reference documentation.  The author is calling these
  diagrams <emphasis role="italic">simplified railroad tracks</emphasis>.  It primarily strives to limit all diagrams to
  2 lines, and does away with much of the complication of true IBM railroad tracks. The body oftext following the syntax
  diagrams will resolve any ambiguities in the diagram.
</para>
<note><title>Note</title><para>
  Not all syntax diagrams may be converted to the simplified railroad tracks at this time.
</para></note>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
  Read the syntax diagrams from left to right, from top to bottom, following the path of the line.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>&gt;&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol indicates the beginning of a statement.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>---&gt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates that the statement syntax is continued on the next
  line. In most cases statement continuation is avoided.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol indicates that a statement is continued from the previous line.
</para>
<para>
  The <computeroutput>---&gt;&lt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates the end of a statement.
</para>
<para>
  Diagrams of syntactical units other than complete statements start with the <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput>
  symbol and end with the  <computeroutput>---&gt;</computeroutput> symbol.

<para>
  In this reference, the syntax being presented is the syntax for method invocations and function calls. The diagrams
  show the method, or function, names and their arguments.  For method invocations, the section the method is included
  in, and / or the text itself, make it clear as to which class the method belongs to.  The arguments to the method or
  function are enclosed in parenthesis and seperated by commas.  The arguments are represented by appropriate variable
  names and these variable names are then described in the text for the method.  When arguments are optional, the
  default value and or behavior if the argument is omitted is also described in the text.  In all cases, the text rather
  than the syntax diagram should be considered definitive.

  The following example shows the described syntax:
