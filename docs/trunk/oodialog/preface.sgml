<chapter id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>
  This book describes the OODialog framework, which is implemented as an external library package, and
  part of the Open Object Rexx distribution on the <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark>
  platform.  It describes the classes in the framework  and how to use the framework to program user
  interfaces.
</para>

<section id="whoshoulduse"><title>Who Should Use This Book</title>
<para>
  This book is intended for Object Rexx programmers who want to design graphical user interfaces for
  their applications.
</para>
</section>

<section id="bookstructure"><title>How This Book is Structured</title>
<para>
  This document should be divided into two parts - a tutorial and a reference.  In the original
  documentation accompanying  IBM's Object Rexx, the documentation was in two parts. Unfortunately, the
  tutorial portion mostly described how to use the IBM Resource Workshop.  The Resource Workshop has not
  been contributed to the open source community and is therefore not a part of the Open Object Rexx
  project. Because the tutorial section was primarily directed towards using the Resource Workshop, it
  does not make much sense in the current context.
</para>
<para>
  This book is primarily a reference that describes the classes and methods in detail.  There is no
  tutorial. The tutorial portion needs to be written (or re-written depending on your point of view.)
</para>
<note><title><emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis></title><para>
  There is no loss of functionality in ooDialog because of the absence of the Resource Workshop.  The
  Windows resource format is well understood and there are any number of free or inexpensive resource
  editors that do a better job of designing dialogs than the Resource Workshop did.  (The Resource
  Workshop was a 16-bit application with limited capacity for the newer features in the Windows user
  interface.) ooDialog works fine with dialogs designed by any modern resource editor.

<section><title>A Note About Program Examples in this Document</title>
<para>The program examples in this document are rendered in a mono-spaced
font that is not completely compatible for cut-and-paste functionality.
Pasteing text into an editor could result in some characters outside of
the standard ASCII character set. Specifically, single-qoute and
double-quote characters are sometimes converted incorrectly when
pasted into an editor.</para>
