<para>
  The ooDialog framework provides a number of classes that are used to access the Windows Shell. The Windows Shell objects
  are implemented using COM (the Component Object Model, a standard introduced by Microsoft.) The Windows Shell should not be
  confused with the Windows window manager, which is responsible for the windowing system in Windows. ooDialog is primarily
  concerned with, and mostly deals with, the windowing system. However, in a modern Windows system, not all tasks can be done
  through the windowing system. Selecting or choosing a folder is an example of a task that is not done through the window
  manager.

<section id="sctShellCOMConsiderations"><title>Shell / COM considerations</title>
<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder class</primary><secondary>Shell / COM considerations</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  In general, the Rexx programmer can work with the <emphasis role="italic">shell</emphasis> object classes in the same way
  as working with any other ooDialog dialog classes. However, because the underlying Windows objects are COM objects rather
  than the usual windowing system window, there are a few considerations the programmer needs to be aware of.
</para>
<variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="varCOMLibrary" xreflabel="COM library"><term><emphasis role="bold">COM Library / Threading:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The use of COM objects requirers that the COM library be initialized and released for <emphasis
    role="italic">each</emphasis> thread that a COM object is used in. Normally the Rexx programmer does not need to be much
    aware of threading and thread issues. However the COM requiement that the library be initialized and released on each
    thread changes that. Using the <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> object as an example, the normal usage pattern would
    be:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="italic">Instantiate a <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> object.</emphasis>
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Configure the browse for folder object.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Show the dialog and get the user's selection.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    This usage pattern is the same for other shell objects such as a <xref linkend="clsOpenFileDialog"/> object, a <xref
    linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> object, etc..
  </para>
  <para>
    As long as this is all done on one thread, there is no problem. The ooDialog framework initializes COM when the object is
    instantiated and releases COM when the underlying dialog is closed, that is when the <xref linkend="mthGetFolderBff"/>,
    <xref linkend="mthGetItemIDList"/>, <xref linkend="mthGetResultCid"/>, etc., methods return. However, if the programmer
    wants, or needs, to implement a different usage pattern, then it becomes the programmer's responsibility to ensure that
    COM is initialized and released properly on each thread. The <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class, and
    other ooDialog shell classes, provide the tools the programmer needs to do that. If COM is not initialized on a thread
    the browse for folder object is running on, then methods invoked on the object may fail. If COM is not released on a
    thread it <emphasis role="italic">was</emphasis> initialized on, then system resource leaks can occur.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is not that complicated and is not really that different than other areas of ooDialog concerning system resources. If
    the programmer wants to use a different font for a dialog control, the <xref linkend="mthSetFont"/> method will fail unless
    the programmer has first initialized a font. If the programmer initializes a font using the <xref
    linkend="mthCreateFontEx"/> method and does not release the font, then system resource leaks can ocurr. The only difference
    here is that this <emphasis role="italic">initialize / release</emphasis> cycle is on a per thread basis.
  </para>
  <para>
    The documentation for the individual attributes and methods of the shell object classes will make note of when the
    programmer needs to consider these threading issues when using the attribute or method. In addition, some of the ooDialog
    shell classes, such as the <xref linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class, provide simplified interfaces where the Rexx
    programmer does not need to be aware of COM.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry id="varItemIDList" xreflabel="item ID list"><term><emphasis role="bold">Item ID List</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The Windows Shell identifies objects in the Shell using a device called an item ID list. Files, folders, printers,
    remote computers all have an item ID list that is used to uniquely identify them to the Shell. The ooDialog programmer
    does not really need to know about the details of these item ID lists. However, it is difficult to document the
    shell classes without making references to an item ID list. Although technically incorrect, the programmer can just think
    of them as <link linkend="defHandle">handles</link>.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry id="varSIGDN" xreflabel="SIGDN"><term><emphasis role="bold">Shell Item Get Display Name</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Each object in the Windows Shell is usually called a <emphasis role="italic">shell item</emphasis> in the MSDN <xref
    linkend="defWindowsDoc"/>. As discussed above each object is uniquely identified by its item ID list. However, these IDs
    are not suitable for identifying a shell item to a Windows user. The shell provides a method for the programmer to get a
    suitable display name for every shell item. For any given shell item, the name of the item can be formatted in a number
    of different ways. The shell uses a special value called a <emphasis role="italic">SIGDN</emphasis> to specify the type
    of display name. In ooDialog, each SIGDN value has a keyword that the programmer uses to specify the display name type in
    methods that allow specifying the type. These key words are case insensitive. The keywords are:

  <varlistentry id="varHResult" xreflabel="HRESULT code"><term><emphasis role="bold">COM result codes</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    In the COM API, methods invoked on COM objects return a result code called a HRESULT. This is just a number, very
    similar to the <xref linkend="defSystemErrorCode"/> of the Win32 API. However, there is no easy way to look up the
    meaning of a HRESULT code in the Windows <xref linkend="defWindowsDoc"/> as there is with a system error code. The return
    from many, if not most, of the ooDialog shell object methods is the HRESULT code returned by the underlying COM objects.
    In a addition, all the ooDialog shell object methods set the <link linkend="dotSystemErrorCode">.SystemErrorCode</link>
    variable to the HRESULT code.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <xref linkend="clsComConstants"/> class provides some constants for common HRESULT codes. The
   <computeroutput>S_OK</computeroutput> constant is the HRESULT code for no error. Its value is 0 and the programmer can
   check for 0 or non-zero to test for success or failure of methods that return a HRESULT code.
  </para>
  <para>
    HRESULT codes are often shown in hexadecimal format. The ooDialog shell object methods return HRESULT codes as a base 10
    number. If the programmer converts the number to hexadecimal format, an Internet search will usually turn up the meaning
    of the error code. For example, one of the shell object methods could return 2147500068. Converted to hexadecimal this is
    0x80004024. A search for 0x80004024 quickly leads to 0x80004024: The specified activation could not occur in the client
    context as specified. In addition, the <xref linkend="mthErrMsg"/> method of the <computeroutput>DlgUtil</computeroutput>
    class will return a formatted error message string for any HRESULT code in either decimal or hexidecimal. The <emphasis
    role="italic">errMsg</emphasis> message works for system error codes also. For example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  hResult = 2147500068
  sysErr  = 2

  say 'HRESULT error code:'
  say .DlgUtil~errMsg(hResult)
  say
  say 'System error code:'
  say .DlgUtil~errMsg(sysErr)

::requires 'ooDialog.cls'

/* Output would be:
HRESULT error code:
Error code 2147500068 (0x80004024): The specified activation could not occur in the client context as specified.


System error code:
Error code 2 (0x00000002): The system cannot find the file specified.

HRESULT success code:
Error code 0 (0x00000000): The operation completed successfully.
*/
]]>
</programlisting>

    Note that the error message itself comes from Microsoft, ooDialog simply reports it and is not responsible for the
    clarity, or lack of clarity, of the message.

<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder</primary><secondary>Special Folder Names</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>SimpleFolderBrowse</primary><secondary>Special Folder Names</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  Windows uses CSIDL (constant special item ID list) names to provide a unique system-independent way to identify special
  folders used frequently by applications. These folders may not have the same name or location on any given system. For
  example, the system folder may be <emphasis role="italic">C:\Windows</emphasis> on one system and <emphasis
  role="italic">C:\Winnt</emphasis> on another.
</para>
<para>
  In Windows Vista and later the CSIDL values have been replaced by Known Folder values, but for compatibility the CSIDL
  values still work. ooDialog does not yet support the known folder values, only the CSIDL names. Some of the methods
  of the <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> class and the <xref linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class accept the
  CSIDL names listed below for arguments. Future enhancements to ooDialog may add other Shell classes that also accept
  the CSIDL names. The names are listed here in one place. The names are not case sensitive, but are otherwise spelled
  exactly as Microsoft does. Google can be used to research any of the names further. Only the names listed are
  recognized in ooDialog.

    <listitem>

      Specifies a caption, or title, for the dialog. The Windows default title is <emphasis role="italic">Browse For

    <varlistentry><term>banner [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies text to use for what Windows calls the <emphasis role="italic">banner</emphasis> for the dialog.  This string
      is displayed above the tree view control in the dialog box. The string can be used to specify instructions to the user.
      By default, Windows, does not display the banner and the area above the tree view is blank. If this argument is

    <para>
      Specifies text to use for a <emphasis role="italic">hint</emphasis> in the dialog. The hint is displayed below the
      bottom of the tree view control and above the bottom row of buttons of the dialog. By default, Windows does not display
      a hint, and the area where the hint would go is removed from the dialog. That is, the bottom row of buttons is placed
      directly below the tree view. If this argument is used, the <xref linkend="atrHint"/> attribute is set to the value
      specified.

      If this argument is omitted, the default ooDialog value, <emphasis role="italic">If the needed folder does not exist it

    <varlistentry><term>startDir [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies an initial selected folder for the dialog. By default, Windows opens the dialog with the top-most item in the
      tree view selected. If a start folder is specified, the folder is selected and, if needed, the tree view items are
      expanded and the tree view is scrolled so that the starting folder is visible in the tree view. If this argument is
      used, the <xref linkend="atrStartDir"/> attribute is set to the value specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      Testing indicates that the folder specified must be a fully qualified path name of an existing directory. If not, the
      operating system seems to just ignore it.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, the ooDialog framework sets the <emphasis role="italic">startDir</emphasis> attribute to
      the empty string. The causes Windows to use its default behaviour.

  <listitem>
  <para>
    When the browse for folder dialog is first instantiated, the ooDialog framework <link
    linkend="varCOMLibrary">initializes</link> the COM library on the thread that is executing and records the
    thread ID in the <emphasis role="italic">initialThread</emphasis> attribute. If the application makes use of the browse
    for folder object in multiple threads, the value of the initial thread ID is helpful in determining if the COM library
    needs to be initialized or not on the currently executing thread. The <xref linkend="mthThreadID"/> method of the <xref
    linkend="clsDlgUtil"/> class can be used to determine the ID of the currently executing.
  </para>
  <para>
    The recomendation is that the browse for folder dialog should be instantiated, used, and disposed of all on the same
    thread. However, if the programmer has a need, or even just the desire, to use the browse for folder object on multiple
    threads, there is no reason why that can not be done. The programmer just needs to manage the initialization and release
    of the COM library herself.

    This example shows a browse for folder object that is reused for the life-time of the dialog.  In the onBrowse() method,
    if the method is not running on the same thread as the BrowseForFolder object was instantiated on, then COM is
    initialized and released each time the object is used.  If it is the same thread, COM is not initialized and not
    released.
  </para>
  <para>
    Finally, during the leaving() method, if the method is running on the same thread as the browse for folder was
    instantiated on, the item <link linkend="varItemIDList">ID</link> list and COM are released.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that this example does run correctly. But, if it were to turn out that the leaving() method was not running on the
    same thread as the define() method had run on, then COM and the item ID list would not be released correctly. It was only
    after some testing that it was determined that the program ran correctly:

    In this example the user is first asked to pick the top-level folder for all backups the application does. Then, the user
    is asked to select the folder for the current backup. To allow the user to pick a virtual folder like the Documents
    subfolder in Libraries, the application uses the <emphasis role="italic">getIDList</emphasis> method for the first
    showing of the browse for folder dialog. The returned item ID list is then set as the root for the second showing of the
    browse for folder dialog. This ensures that the user picks a subfolder of the first folder picked.
  </para>
  <para>
    Some other things to note about the example. For the first showing of the <xref linkend="atrOptionsBff"/> attribute is
    set to the empty string and the root is set to CSIDL_DESKTOP. CSIDL_DESKTOP is the root of the entire shell namespace.
    This combination allows the browsing of every folder in the shell. In the first invocation of <emphasis
    role="italic">getItemIDList</emphasis>, note the use of the <emphasis role="italic">reuse</emphasis> arg. The prevents
    the COM library from being released. Then in the last invocation of <emphasis role="italic">getFolder</emphasis>, the
    <emphasis role="italic">reuse</emphasis> arg is not used, and the ooDialog framework takes care of releasing the COM
    library. However, if the user cancels the first showing of the dialog, the application handles releasing COM before it
    returns:

<para>
  The <computeroutput>CommonDialogCustomizations</computeroutput> class is a <emphasis role="italic">mixin</emphasis> class
  that provides a way to customize a <xref linkend="clsCommonItemDialog"/> object. The
  <computeroutput>CommonDialogCustomizations</computeroutput> class has methods that allow an application to add controls
  to a common item dialog. To use this <emphasis role="italic">mixin</emphasis> class, the programmer <emphasis
  role="bold">must</emphasis> add it to the common item dialog's inheritance chain before instantiating a <xref
  linkend="clsOpenFileDialog"/> or <xref linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> object as shown in this code snippet:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  .CommonItemDialog~inherit(.CommonDialogCustomizations)

  sfd = .SaveFileDialog~new

  -- Customize the dialog
  ret = sfd~startVisualGroup(IDC_GB_RADIOS, 'Save file with extension:')
  ret = sfd~addRadioButtonList(IDC_RBL_RADIOS)
  ...
]]>
</programlisting>

</para>
<para>
  Controls should be added to the dialog before the dialog is shown. The layout of the controls is implied by the order
  in which they are added. They can be added above or below the standard file dialog's set of controls. Once the dialog is
  shown, controls cannot be added or removed, but the existing controls can be hidden or disabled at any time. Their labels
  can also be changed at any time.
</para>
<para>
  Container controls are controls that can have items added to them. Container controls include combo boxes, menus, drop-down
  lists attached to the Open or Save button, and any radio button groups. The order that items appear in a container is the
  order in which they were added. The operating system does not provide a way to reorder them. IDs are scoped to the parent
  control. Container controls, with the exception of menus, have a selected item.
</para>
<para>
  Items with a container control cannot be changed after they have been created, except for their enabled and visible states.
  However, they can be added and removed at any time. For example, if the programmer needed to change the text of a menu, she
  would have to remove the current menu and add another with the correct text.

  The common item dialog was formerly known as the common file dialog. It is used in two variations, the open file dialog and
  the save file dialog. The common item dialog is only available on a Vista or later version of Windows. The <emphasis
  role="italic">CommonItemDialog</emphasis> class provides most of the implementation of the common item dialog, but is not
  instantiated directly by the Rexx programmer. Rather the programmer instantiates one of its concrete subclasses, the <xref
  linkend="clsOpenFileDialog"/> class, or <xref linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> class.
</para>
<para>
  The common item dialog is more full featured than the earlier common file dialog. It is also more customizable. ooDialog
  supplies some helper classes for the common item dialog:

    When the common item file dialog is first instantiated, the ooDialog framework initializes the COM library on the thread

    It is not recommended that the programmer use a single Rexx common item dialog object on more than one thread. It is
    recommended that the programmer instantiate the common item dialog, configure the dialog, show the dialog, retrieve the
    user's input, and release the dialog, all on the same thread. It is possible to use the same object on multiple threads.
    However, ensuring that system resources and the COM library are cleaned up properly becomes more difficult to manage.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the programmer uses the same common item dialog object on more than one thread, then it becomes the programmer's
    responsibility to ensure that the COM library is initialized and released on each thread, that the init and release are
    in balanced pairs, and that release is called once and only once for the object. This is certainly doable, however it is
    more complicated then restricting the use of the object to one thread.

  <para>
    Unlike the <xref linkend="mthSetOkButtonLabel"/> method, which is supplied by the underlying COM dialog object, the
    <emphasis role="italic">setCancelButtonLabel</emphasis> is an enhancement added by ooDialog. Because of this, its use is
    slightly different than the use of the <emphasis role="italic">setOkButtonLable</emphasis> method.
  </para>
  <para>
    The ooDialog framework gets a handle to the Cancel button and resets its label to that specified. The button does not
    exist until the dialog is created through the <xref linkend="mthShow"/> method. Since the <emphasis
    role="italic">show</emphasis> method does not return until the dialog is destroyed, the programmer needs to invoke this
    method from an event handler in the <xref linkend="clsCommonDialogEvents"/> class. It has been observed that the folder
    <link linkend="mthOnFolderChanging">changing</link> event is always invoked the first time the dialog is shown, before it
    is visible. This makes that event handler an ideal place to change the label of the Cancel button. This technique is
    shown in the example. Clever programmers may implement alternative ways to use the <emphasis
    role="italic">setCancelButtonLabel</emphasis>.

    Currently the only way to get an item ID list is through the <xref linkend="mthGetItemIDList"/> method of the <xref

  A <computeroutput>CommonDialogEvents</computeroutput> object is a collection of event handling methods. When an

  The <computeroutput>CommonDialogEvents</computeroutput> class has an event handler, with a default implementation, for
  every event notification that the common item dialog can send. To use the common dialog events class, the programmer

  notifications.

<indexterm><primary>ShellItemFilter class</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  A <computeroutput>ShellItemFilter</computeroutput> object can be used if an application needs to perform special filtering
  to remove some items from the common item dialog's view. The class contains only one instance method, <xref
  linkend="mthIncludeItem"/>. When a shell item filter object is set as the filter, through the <xref
  linkend="mthSetFilter"/> method, of a common item dialog, the <emphasis role="italic">includeItem</emphasis> method is
  invoked for each item that would normally be included in the view. If the method returns S_OK the item is included in the
  view and if the method returns S_FALSE the item is not included in the view.
</para>
<para>
  The default implementation of <emphasis role="italic">includeItem</emphasis> simply returns S_OK for every item. To use the
  shell item filter to actually filter the items in the view of a common item dialog, the programmer creates a subclass of
  the <computeroutput>ShellItemFilter</computeroutput> and sets that object as the filter for a common item dialog using the
  <emphasis role="italic">setFiter</emphasis> method. In the subclass, the programmer over-rides the <emphasis
  role="italic">includItem</emphasis> method and returns S_OK or S_FALSE for each item, depending on the logic of the
  application.
</para>
<para>
  The MSDN <xref linkend="defWindowsDoc"/> MSDN says both:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
  To filter by file type, <xref linkend="mthSetFileTypes"/> should be used, because in folders with a large number of

    If the user cancels the dialog, the empty string is returned, otherwise the fully qualified path to the folder the user
    picked is returned. However it is possible to set up the dialog in a way such that the user can pick a virtual folder.
    Virtual folders do not have a file system path. The <computeroutput>.nil</computeroutput> object is returned if a virtual
    folder is picked.

    The <emphasis role="italic">SimpleFolderBrowse</emphasis> routine is just a shortcut to using the <xref
    linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class. It is intended to be simple to use and is restricted to file system paths. The
    Windows Browse For Folders dialog has more capabilities than can be accessed through this routine, but the capabilities
    are less likely to be useful in most ooRexx programs. The <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> class allows access to all
    features of the Windows Browse For Folders dialog, but it is correspondingly more complex to use.
