<para>
  The ooDialog framework provides a number of classes that are used to access the Windows Shell. The Windows Shell objects
  are implemented using COM (the Component Object Model, a standard introduced by Microsoft.) The Windows Shell should not be
  confused with the Windows window manager, which is responsible for the windowing system in Windows. ooDialog is primarily
  concerned with, and mostly deals with, the windowing system. However, in a modern Windows system, not all tasks can be done
  through the windowing system. Selecting or choosing a folder is an example of a task that is not done through the window
  manager.

<section id="sctShellCOMConsiderations"><title>Shell / COM considerations</title>
<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder class</primary><secondary>Shell / COM considerations</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  In general, the Rexx programmer can work with the <emphasis role="italic">shell</emphasis> object classes in the same way
  as working with any other ooDialog dialog classes. However, because the underlying Windows objects are COM objects rather
  than the usual windowing system window, there are a few considerations the programmer needs to be aware of.
</para>
<variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="varCOMLibrary" xreflabel="COM library"><term><emphasis role="bold">COM Library / Threading:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The use of COM objects requirers that the COM library be initialized and released for <emphasis
    role="italic">each</emphasis> thread that a COM object is used in. Normally the Rexx programmer does not need to be much
    aware of threading and thread issues. However the COM requiement that the library be initialized and released on each
    thread changes that. Using the <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> object as an example, the normal usage pattern would
    be:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="italic">Instantiate a <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> object.</emphasis>
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Configure the browse for folder object.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Show the dialog and get the user's selection.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    This usage pattern is the same for other shell objects such as a <xref linkend="clsOpenFileDialog"/> object, a <xref
    linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> object, etc..
  </para>
  <para>
    As long as this is all done on one thread, there is no problem. The ooDialog framework initializes COM when the object is
    instantiated and releases COM when the underlying dialog is closed, that is when the <xref linkend="mthGetFolderBff"/>,
    <xref linkend="mthGetItemIDList"/>, <xref linkend="mthGetResultCid"/>, etc., methods return. However, if the programmer
    wants, or needs, to implement a different usage pattern, then it becomes the programmer's responsibility to ensure that
    COM is initialized and released properly on each thread. The <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class, and
    other ooDialog shell classes, provide the tools the programmer needs to do that. If COM is not initialized on a thread
    the browse for folder object is running on, then methods invoked on the object may fail. If COM is not released on a
    thread it <emphasis role="italic">was</emphasis> initialized on, then system resource leaks can occur.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is not that complicated and is not really that different than other areas of ooDialog concerning system resources. If
    the programmer wants to use a different font for a dialog control, the <xref linkend="mthSetFont"/> method will fail unless
    the programmer has first initialized a font. If the programmer initializes a font using the <xref
    linkend="mthCreateFontEx"/> method and does not release the font, then system resource leaks can ocurr. The only difference
    here is that this <emphasis role="italic">initialize / release</emphasis> cycle is on a per thread basis.
  </para>
  <para>
    The documentation for the individual attributes and methods of the shell object classes will make note of when the
    programmer needs to consider these threading issues when using the attribute or method. In addition, some of the ooDialog
    shell classes, such as the <xref linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class, provide simplified interfaces where the Rexx
    programmer does not need to be aware of COM.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry id="varItemIDList" xreflabel="item ID list"><term><emphasis role="bold">Item ID List</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The Windows Shell identifies objects in the Shell using a device called an item ID list. Files, folders, printers,
    remote computers all have an item ID list that is used to uniquely identify them to the Shell. The ooDialog programmer
    does not really need to know about the details of these item ID lists. However, it is difficult to document the
    shell classes without making references to an item ID list. Although technically incorrect, the programmer can just think
    of them as <link linkend="defHandle">handles</link>.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry id="varHResult" xreflabel="HRESULT code"><term><emphasis role="bold">COM result codes</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    In the COM API, methods invoked on COM objects return a result code called a HRESULT. This is just a number, very
    similar to the <xref linkend="defSystemErrorCode"/> of the Win32 API. However, there is no easy way to look up the
    meaning of a HRESULT code in the Windows <xref linkend="defWindowsDoc"/> as there is with a system error code. The return
    from many, if not most, of the ooDialog shell object methods is the HRESULT code returned by the underlying COM objects.
    In a addition, all the ooDialog shell object methods set the <link linkend="dotSystemErrorCode">.SystemErrorCode</link>
    variable to the HRESULT code.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <xref linkend="clsComConstants"/> class provides some constants for common HRESULT codes. The
   <computeroutput>S_OK</computeroutput> constant is the HRESULT code for no error. Its value is 0 and the programmer can
   check for 0 or non-zero to test for success or failure of methods that return a HRESULT code.
  </para>
  <para>
    HRESULT codes are often shown in hexadecimal format. The ooDialog shell object methods return HRESULT codes as a base 10
    number. If the programmer converts the number to hexadecimal format, an Internet search will usually turn up the meaning
    of the error code. For example, one of the shell object methods could return 2147500068. Converted to hexadecimal this is
    0x80004024. A search for 0x80004024 quickly leads to 0x80004024: The specified activation could not occur in the client
    context as specified. In addition, the <xref linkend="mthErrMsg"/> method of the <computeroutput>DlgUtil</computeroutput>
    class will return a formatted error message string for any HRESULT code in either decimal or hexidecimal. The <emphasis
    role="italic">errMsg</emphasis> message works for system error codes also. For example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  hResult = 2147500068
  sysErr  = 2

  say 'HRESULT error code:'
  say .DlgUtil~errMsg(hResult)
  say
  say 'System error code:'
  say .DlgUtil~errMsg(sysErr)

::requires 'ooDialog.cls'

/* Output would be:
HRESULT error code:
Error code 2147500068 (0x80004024): The specified activation could not occur in the client context as specified.


System error code:
Error code 2 (0x00000002): The system cannot find the file specified.

HRESULT success code:
Error code 0 (0x00000000): The operation completed successfully.
*/
]]>
</programlisting>

    Note that the error message itself comes from Microsoft, ooDialog simply reports it and is not responsible for the
    clarity, or lack of clarity, of the message.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<section id="sctSpecialFolderNames" xreflabel="Special Folder Names"><title>Special Folder Names</title>
<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder</primary><secondary>Special Folder Names</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>SimpleFolderBrowse</primary><secondary>Special Folder Names</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  Windows uses CSIDL (constant special item ID list) names to provide a unique system-independent way to identify special
  folders used frequently by applications. These folders may not have the same name or location on any given system. For
  example, the system folder may be <emphasis role="italic">C:\Windows</emphasis> on one system and <emphasis
  role="italic">C:\Winnt</emphasis> on another.
</para>
<para>
  In Windows Vista and later the CSIDL values have been replaced by Known Folder values, but for compatibility the CSIDL
  values still work. ooDialog does not yet support the known folder values, only the CSIDL names. Some of the methods
  of the <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> class and the <xref linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class accept the
  CSIDL names listed below for arguments. Future enhancements to ooDialog may add other Shell classes that also accept
  the CSIDL names. The names are listed here in one place. The names are not case sensitive, but are otherwise spelled
  exactly as Microsoft does. Google can be used to research any of the names further. Only the names listed are
  recognized in ooDialog.

  A BrowseForFolder object represents the Windows <emphasis role="italic">Browse For Folder</emphasis> common dialog. The
  Windows operating system provides a number of common dialogs for use by applications to allow presenting the user with an
  unified generic method to do common tasks. The purpose of the Browse For Folder dialog is specifically to allow the user to

    <varlistentry><term>title [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies a caption, or title, for the dialog. The Windows default title is <emphasis role="italic">Browse For

    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies text to use for what Windows calls the <emphasis role="italic">banner</emphasis> for the dialog.  This string
      is displayed above the tree view control in the dialog box. The string can be used to specify instructions to the user.
      By default, Windows, does not display the banner and the area above the tree view is blank. If this argument is

    <para>
      Specifies text to use for a <emphasis role="italic">hint</emphasis> in the dialog. The hint is displayed below the
      bottom of the tree view control and above the bottom row of buttons of the dialog. By default, Windows does not display
      a hint, and the area where the hint would go is removed from the dialog. That is, the bottom row of buttons is placed
      directly below the tree view. If this argument is used, the <xref linkend="atrHint"/> attribute is set to the value
      specified.

    <varlistentry><term>startDir [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies an initial selected folder for the dialog. By default, Windows opens the dialog with the top-most item in the
      tree view selected. If a start folder is specified, the folder is selected and, if needed, the tree view items are
      expanded and the tree view is scrolled so that the starting folder is visible in the tree view. If this argument is
      used, the <xref linkend="atrStartDir"/> attribute is set to the value specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      Testing indicates that the folder specified must be a fully qualified path name of an existing directory. If not, the
      operating system seems to just ignore it.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, the ooDialog framework sets the <emphasis role="italic">startDir</emphasis> attribute to
      the empty string. The causes Windows to use its default behaviour.

  <listitem>
  <para>
    When the browse for folder dialog is first instantiated, the ooDialog framework <link
    linkend="varCOMLibrary">initializes</link> the COM library on the thread that is executing and records the
    thread ID in the <emphasis role="italic">initialThread</emphasis> attribute. If the application makes use of the browse
    for folder object in multiple threads, the value of the initial thread ID is helpful in determining if the COM library
    needs to be initialized or not on the currently executing thread. The <xref linkend="mthThreadID"/> method of the <xref
    linkend="clsDlgUtil"/> class can be used to determine the ID of the currently executing.
  </para>
  <para>
    The recomendation is that the browse for folder dialog should be instantiated, used, and disposed of all on the same
    thread. However, if the programmer has a need, or even just the desire, to use the browse for folder object on multiple
    threads, there is no reason why that can not be done. The programmer just needs to manage the initialization and release
    of the COM library herself.

    This example shows a browse for folder object that is reused for the life-time of the dialog.  In the onBrowse() method,
    if the method is not running on the same thread as the BrowseForFolder object was instantiated on, then COM is
    initialized and released each time the object is used.  If it is the same thread, COM is not initialized and not
    released.
  </para>
  <para>
    Finally, during the leaving() method, if the method is running on the same thread as the browse for folder was
    instantiated on, the item <link linkend="varItemIDList">ID</link> list and COM are released.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that this example does run correctly. But, if it were to turn out that the leaving() method was not running on the
    same thread as the define() method had run on, then COM and the item ID list would not be released correctly. It was only
    after some testing that it was determined that the program ran correctly:

    In this example the user is first asked to pick the top-level folder for all backups the application does. Then, the user
    is asked to select the folder for the current backup. To allow the user to pick a virtual folder like the Documents
    subfolder in Libraries, the application uses the <emphasis role="italic">getIDList</emphasis> method for the first
    showing of the browse for folder dialog. The returned item ID list is then set as the root for the second showing of the
    browse for folder dialog. This ensures that the user picks a subfolder of the first folder picked.
  </para>
  <para>
    Some other things to note about the example. For the first showing of the <xref linkend="atrOptionsBff"/> attribute is
    set to the empty string and the root is set to CSIDL_DESKTOP. CSIDL_DESKTOP is the root of the entire shell namespace.
    This combination allows the browsing of every folder in the shell. In the first invocation of <emphasis
    role="italic">getItemIDList</emphasis>, note the use of the <emphasis role="italic">reuse</emphasis> arg. The prevents
    the COM library from being released. Then in the last invocation of <emphasis role="italic">getFolder</emphasis>, the
    <emphasis role="italic">reuse</emphasis> arg is not used, and the ooDialog framework takes care of releasing the COM
    library. However, if the user cancels the first showing of the dialog, the application handles releasing COM before it
    returns:

  The <computeroutput>CommonDialogCustomizations</computeroutput> class is a <emphasis role="italic">mixin</emphasis> class
  that provides a way to customize a <xref linkend="clsCommonItemDialog"/> object. The
  <computeroutput>CommonDialogCustomizations</computeroutput> class has methods that allow an application to add controls
  to a common item dialog. To use this <emphasis role="italic">mixin</emphasis> class, the programmer <emphasis
  role="bold">must</emphasis> add it to the common item dialog's inheritance chain before instantiating a <xref
  linkend="clsOpenFileDialog"/> or <xref linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> object as shown in this code snippet:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  .CommonItemDialog~inherit(.CommonDialogCustomizations)

  sfd = .SaveFileDialog~new

  -- Customize the dialog
  ret = sfd~startVisualGroup(IDC_GB_RADIOS, 'Save file with extension:')
  ret = sfd~addRadioButtonList(IDC_RBL_RADIOS)
  ...
]]>
</programlisting>

</para>
<para>
  Controls should be added to the dialog before the dialog is shown. The layout of the controls is implied by the order
  in which they are added. They can be added above or below the standard file dialog's set of controls. Once the dialog is
  shown, controls cannot be added or removed, but the existing controls can be hidden or disabled at any time. Their labels
  can also be changed at any time.
</para>
<para>
  Container controls are controls that can have items added to them. Container controls include combo boxes, menus, drop-down
  lists attached to the Open or Save button, and any radio button groups. The order that items appear in a container is the
  order in which they were added. The operating system does not provide a way to reorder them. IDs are scoped to the parent
  control. Container controls, with the exception of menus, have a selected item.
</para>
<para>
  Items with a container control cannot be changed after they have been created, except for their enabled and visible states.
  However, they can be added and removed at any time. For example, if the programmer needed to change the text of a menu, she
  would have to remove the current menu and add another with the correct text.

<para>
  The common item dialog was formerly known as the common file dialog. It is used in two variations, the open file dialog and
  the save file dialog. The common item dialog is only available on a Vista or later version of Windows. The <emphasis
  role="italic">CommonItemDialog</emphasis> class provides most of the implementation of the common item dialog, but is not
  instantiated directly by the Rexx programmer. Rather the programmer instantiates one of its concrete subclasses, the <xref
  linkend="clsOpenFileDialog"/> class, or <xref linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> class.
</para>
<para>
  The common item dialog is more full featured than the earlier common file dialog. It is also more customizable. ooDialog
  supplies some helper classes for the common item dialog:
</para>

  The <xref linkend="clsCommonDialogEvents"/> class: Provides a way to connect event notifications sent from the common item
  dialog.
</para>

  The OpenFileDialog class is a concrete subclass of the <xref linkend="clsCommonItemDialog"/>. The programmer does not
  instantiate a new <computeroutput>CommonItemDialog</computeroutput> object, but rather instantiates a new
  <computeroutput>OpenFileDiaog</computeroutput> or <xref linkend="clsSaveFileDialog"/> object. The
  <computeroutput>OpenFileDialog</computeroutput> is only available on Windows Vista or later operating systems.

<para>
  The SimpleFolderBrowse object displays the Windows common Browse For Folder dialog and returns the user's selection. It is
  a simplified version of the <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> dialog that is designed to be easy to use, and does not
  have as many configuration options as the <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> object does.
</para>
<para>
  The Windows common Browse For Folder dialog allows the user to select a folder from a tree-like display of the computer's
  file system. The Browse For Folder dialog is specifically for opening or choosing folders.
</para>

<section id="sctMethodsSimpleFolderBrowse"><title>Method Table</title>
<para>
  The following table lists the class and instance methods of the <computeroutput>SimpleFolderBrowse</computeroutput> class.
  This simple to use dialog only has a single class method:

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>capt [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies a caption, or title, for the dialog. The Windows default title is <emphasis role="italic">Browse For

    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>bnr [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies text to use for what Windows calls the <emphasis role="italic">banner</emphasis> for the dialog.  This string
      is displayed above the tree view control in the dialog box. The string can be used to specify instructions to the user.
      By default nothing is displayed for the banner and the area above the tree view is blank.
    </para>

    <varlistentry><term>hnt [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies text to use for a <emphasis role="italic">hint</emphasis> in the dialog. The hint is displayed below the
      bottom of the tree view control and above the bottom row of buttons of the dialog. By default there is no hint, and
      the area where the hint would go is removed from the dialog. That is, the bottom row of buttons is placed directly
      below the tree view.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>start [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies an initial selected folder for the dialog. By default, the dialog opens with the top-most item in the tree
      view selected. If a start folder is specified, the folder is selected and, if needed, the tree view items are expanded
      and the tree view is scrolled so that the starting folder is visible in the tree view.
    </para>
    <para>
      Testing indicates that the folder specified must be a fully qualified path name of an existing directory. If not, the
      operating system seems to just ignore it.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>root [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies the root for the tree view in the dialog. The root is the location of the root folder from which the user
      starts browsing. Only the specified folder and any subfolders that are beneath it in the namespace hierarchy
      will appear in the dialog box. The user can not browse above the root folder. If this argument is omitted, the
      operating system uses the namespace root (the desktop folder.)
    </para>
    <para>
      Specify either a fully qualified file system path name, or use one of the <xref linkend="sctSpecialFolderNames"/>.
    </para>

    <varlistentry><term>owner [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      The Rexx dialog object that is to be the owner window of the browse for folder dialog. The owner dialog is disabled
      until the browse for folder dialog is closed by the user.

  <para>
    If the user cancels the dialog, the empty string is returned, otherwise the fully qualified path to the folder the user
    picked is returned. However it is possible to set up the dialog in a way such that the user can pick a virtual folder.
    Virtual folders do not have a file system path. The <computeroutput>.nil</computeroutput> object is returned if a virtual
    folder is picked.

    The <computeroutput>SimpleFolderBrowse</computeroutput> dialog is intended to be simple to use and is restricted to file
    system paths. The Windows Browse For Folders dialog has more capabilities than can be accessed through the
    <computeroutput>SimpleFolderBrowse</computeroutput> class, but the capabilities are less likely to be useful in most
    ooRexx programs. The <xref linkend="clsBrowseForFolder"/> class allows access to all features of the Windows Browse For
    Folders dialog, but it is correspondingly more complex to use.
