<para>
  The distribution of ooDialog includes an executable file, named: <computeroutput>ooDialog.exe</computeroutput>. This
  executable file is located in the same directory as the <computeroutput>oodialog.dll</computeroutput> and
  <computeroutput>ooDialog.cls</computeroutput> files. In the typical installation of ooRexx or ooDialog, this diretory will
  be in the PATH which allows ooDialog.exe to be accessed from anywhere on the computer.
</para>

<section id="sctOverView"><title>OverView</title>
<indexterm><primary>ooDialog executable</primary><secondary>overview</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  The ooDialog executable provides a number of enhancements and services to use along with the ooDialog framework. These
  range from the simplistic to the relatively complex. There is no need, or requirement, to ever run the executable if the
  ooDialog user is not interested in any of the features provide by <computeroutput>ooDialog.exe</computeroutput>. That is,
  currently, there are no dependencies on <computeroutput>ooDialog.exe</computeroutput> in the ooDialog framework.
</para>

<section id="sctOodExeCLO"><title>ooDialog.Exe Command Line Options</title>
<indexterm><primary>ooDialog executable</primary><secondary>command line options</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  One of the simplest features ooDialog.exe provides is to display information about the current installation of ooDialog.
  Since the installation of ooDialog has been decoupled from the installation of ooRexx, the version of ooRexx no longer has
  any relation to the installed version of ooDialog. ooDialog.exe can be executed from a command prompt, using the
  <computeroutput>-v</computeroutput> option, to quickly determine the version of the installed ooDialog:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\Rexx>oodialog -v
ooDialog 4.2.4.9574

C:\Rexx>
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  If ooDialog.exe is executed from a command prompt with no options, or if it is double-clicked in Explorer, it opens an
  informational window that displays the ooDialog version and other details concerning the executable and its purpose.
  Executing ooDialog.exe from a command prompt with the <computeroutput>-h</computeroutput> option displays the syntax for
  ooDialog.exe. For example:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\Rexx>oodialog -h
Syntax:

    ooDialog [option flags] [programName] [arg1 arg2 ... argN]

option flags:
  -h        Show this, the short help text.
  /?        Same as -h.
  -H        Show the long help text.
  --help    If from a console window, show the long help.
  -s        Display the ooDialog Setup dialog.
  -v        Print the short version string.
  -V        Print the long version string.
  --version If from a console window, print the long version string.

programName:
  The first argument that does not begin with '-' is taken as the name
  of a Rexxx program to be executed.

arg1 ... argN:
  Arguments 1 through N are passed on to programName.


C:\Rexx>
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  Executing ooDialog.exe from a command prompt with the <computeroutput>--version</computeroutput> option displays more
  detailed information concerning the ooDialog version, along with the version of ooRexx that ooDialog is running under. For
  example:
<programlisting>

<section id="sctOodExePL"><title>ooDialog.Exe as a Program Launcher</title>
<indexterm><primary>ooDialog executable</primary><secondary>program launcher</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  A primary use of ooDialog.exe is to execute ooDialog programs without displaying a secondary console window. This is very
  much like the rexxhide.exe program that comes with the Windows ooRexx distribution. The ooRexx interpreter (rexx.exe) is
  built as a console application. This is what gives the interpreter access to the standard input and output streams. Which
  in turn allows the <emphasis role="italic">say</emphasis> instruction to write text to the console and the <emphasis
  role="italic">pull</emphasis> instruction to retrieve text the user has typed.
</para>
<para>
  Because it is a console application, whenever rexx.exe starts, the operating system creates a console window if it is not
  already being executed from a console window. For a purely graphical application, as most ooDialog programs are, this
  secondary console window can be an annoyance. The ooDialog executable, (and rexxhide.exe,) are built as a windowed
  applicattion and internally use the ooRexx naive API to start an instance of the interpreter to execute the Rexx program.
  Because they are built as a windowed application, no console window is created by the operating system.
</para>
<para>
  One drawback that rexxhide.exe has, is that since it is built as a windowed application with no console window, all text
  normally writen to the console is lost. This includes the error condition text written when a condition is raised. Because
  of this Rexx programs run under rexxhide.exe just silently end if a problem in the program raises a condition. This can be
  frustrating because the program will just terminate and there is no way to know why.
</para>
<para>
  The ooDialog executable has been enhanced to help with this situation. If a condition is raised and the Rex program is
  terminated, oodialg.exe traps the condition text and then displays it in a window when the interpreter terminates.
</para>

<note><title>Note</title>
  <para>
    This discussion on using ooDialgo.exe as a program launcher mostly refers to launching ooDialog programs. However,
    ooDialog.exe will execute any ooRexx program. It is not restricted to launching only ooDialog programs.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
  There are a number of ways to launch ooDialog programs using ooDialog.exe:

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">direct invocation:</emphasis></term>

    From a command prompt simply use ooDialog.exe instead of rexx.exe:

  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">within a shortcut or Start menu item:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Typically, people create a short cut to an ooDialog program using rexxhide.exe. Then, double-clicking the short cut in
    Explorer launches the ooDialog program with no console Window. The ooRexx installer has set up these types of short cuts
    for ooDialog example programs for years. In the short cut, ooDialog.exe can be used instead of rexxhide.exe:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* The ooRexx installer has set up a Start menu item to the ooDialog sample.rex programe like this: */

Target type:      Application
Target location:  ooRexx
Target:           C:\Rexx\ooRexx\rexxhide.exe "C:\Rexx\ooRexx\samples\oodialog\sample.rex"
Start in:         C:\Rexx\ooRexx\samples\oodialog\

/* Use this for the short cut instead: */

Target type:      Application
Target location:  ooRexx

</programlisting>
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">with drag and drop:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The ooDialog exectuable is drag and drop enabled. That is, ooDialog.exe can serve as a drop target. In Explorer when an
    ooDialog program file is dragged and dropped on the ooDialog.exe icon, the ooDialog program will execute without a
    secondary console window. A common use of this ability would be to create a short cut to ooDialog.exe on the desktop and
    drag and drop ooDialog programs on the short cut.
  </para>
  <para>
    This snapshot of a portion of a user's Desktop shows a short cut icon to ooDialog.exe. ooDialog programs such as
    <computeroutput>columnIcons.rex</computeroutput> can be dragged from Explorer and dropped on the short cut, which
    launches the ooDialog program.

  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">using file types and associations:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Probably one of the best ways to use ooDialog.exe to execute ooDialog programs is through the use of file type
    associations. Once a file type has been created for ooDialog.exe, and an extension associated with that file type,
    double-clicking on any file with the extension will execute the ooDialog program.
  </para>
  <para>
    The figure below shows a user's system where a file type has been created for ooDialog.exe and the extension <emphasis
    role="italic">.ood</emphasis> is associated with that file type. Double-clicking on
    <computeroutput>columnIcons.ood</computeroutput> has executed that ooDialog program.
    <figure id="figFileAssociation"><title>.ood Extension Associated with ooDialog.exe</title>

    <imagedata fileref="images/oodFileAssociation.jpg" scale="60" />
    </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    </figure>
  </para>
  <para>
    Although it is not discernible from the figure itself, the created file type on the user's system is
    <computeroutput>ooRexx.ooDialog.1</computeroutput>. File types and associations are relatively easy to create and manage
    from the command prompt, or through Explorer. People familar will file type associations will recognize that the
    following displays the file type and association from the system in the figure above:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\Rexx>ftype ooRexx.ooDialog.1
ooRexx.ooDialog.1="C:\Rexx\ooRexx\ooDialog.exe" "%1" %*

C:\Rexx>assoc .ood
.ood=ooRexx.ooDialog.1

C:\Rexx>
]]>
</programlisting>
    For people not familar with creating file types and associations, ooDialog.exe can be used to configure file associations
    for the system through a graphical user interface. This use of ooDialgo.exe is explained in the next section

<section id="sctOodExeFA"><title>ooDialog.Exe Configure File Associations</title>
<indexterm><primary>ooDialog executable</primary><secondary>configure file associations</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  Windows has promoted a scheme to identify the type of a file through the file name extension of the file. (The extension
  part of a file name is everything following the last dot in the file name.) Different types of files are then associated
  with the program that uses the file. When a file type and its association are made known to the operating system, when the
  user interacts with a known file type, the operarting system will start the program that uses the file directly. For
  instance, text files can be associated with the user's favorite editor. Double-clicking on a text file will then start the
  editor will the file ready to edit.
</para>
<para>
  The <emphasis role="italic">Configure ooDialog Services</emphasis> dialog is used to start the process of configuring file
  associations for ooDialog.exe:
  <figure id="figConfigServices"><title>Configure Services Dialog</title>
  <mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/oodConfigureServices.jpg" scale="80" />
  </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
  </figure>
  Future versions of ooDialog may have the ability to configure more services than just file associations, in which case this
  dialog will be expanded to allow that configuration. Currently, only file associations are configured through this dialog.
</para>
<para>
  The configure services dialog can be brought up in two ways. From a command prompt, the <emphasis
  role="italic">-s</emphasis> option will immediately start the dialog:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\Rexx>oodialog -s

C:\Rexx>
]]>
</programlisting>
  Starting ooDialog.exe with no arguments, either from the command prompt or by double-clicking ooDialog.exe, brings up the
  information display window:
  <figure id="figInformationWindow"><title>ooDialogInformationWindow</title>
  <mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/oodInformationWindow.jpg" scale="70" />
  </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
  </figure>
  Check the <emphasis role="italic">Configure other ooDialog services</emphasis> check box. The <emphasis
  role="italic">Close</emphasis> button's label will change to <emphasis role="italic">Continue</emphasis> and clicking the
  button starts the configure services dialog.
</para>
<para>
  The configure services dialog can be used to configure file type associations and the PATHEXT environment variable for
  either the current user, or for all users. Any user can configure file associations or environment variables for herself or
  himself. With the heightened security procedures introduced in Windows Vista and later, users can no longer set
  configurations of all users, unless they do so from an elevated process. By default the configure services dialog will be
  set to configure for the current user. If this is changed to all users, and the current process is not elevated, the UAC
  shield icon will be placed on the <emphasis role="italic">Configure</emphasis> button to indicate that the task requires
  administrator credentials. If <emphasis role="italic">Configure</emphasis> is clicked, the Credential UI will be displayed
  to obtain the credentials.
</para>
<para>
  This is shown below. Note that the lower left quadrant of the dialog displays the security status of the running process:
  <figure id="figElevatedDialog"><title>Elevation Required</title>
  <mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/oodElevatedDialog.jpg" scale="80" />
  </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
  </figure>
</para>
<para>
  Once the <emphasis role="italic">scope</emphasis> (the current user or all users) of the task is selected using the radio
  buttons, the user of the dialog proceeds by clicking the <emphasis role="italic">Configure</emphasis> button. As hinted at,
  the user of the dialog can only work with one scope at a time. However, when the selected scope is configured, the user
  will be returned to the configure user services dialog, and could then select to configure the other scope if desired.
</para>
<para>
  This figure shows the dialog that is used to configure file associations for ooDialog.exe and the use of the
  dialog is explained in the following text:
  <figure id="figConfigFileAssociations"><title>Drag and Drop Scenario</title>
  <mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/oodConfigureFileAssociations.jpg" scale="70" />

  </mediaobject>
  </figure>
</para>
<para>
  To better explain how to use the dialog to configure the file associations, and or the PATHEXT, each part of the dialog
  will be discussed in turn. <emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> it is important to keep in mind that file associations
  for all users and the current user are merged together by the operating system. Therefore the file associations in effect
  for any user are those registered for all users and those registered just for herself or himself. However, the operating
  system does not merge the PATHEXT. If there is a PATHEXT defined for the current user, the operating system <emphasis
  role="italic">replaces</emphasis> the all users PATHEXT with the PATHEXT defined by the current user.
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Upper Third Portion:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The upper third of the dialog is an informtional display only. It shows the scope of the current task, the process
    execution status, if ooDialog.exe is, or is not, registered as a file type, etc..
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">The Register Button:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The large register button is used to register, or un-register the ooDialog program file type. The label of the button
    changes to reflect the current status of the registration. If the file type is currently registered, the button is used
    to un-register it. If the file type is not registered, the button is used to register the file type.
  </para>
  <para>
    The registration or un-registration takes place immediately when the button is clicked. If the ooDialog program type is
    un-registered, all extensions associated with the file type are un-associated at the same time, for the current scope.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">File Association Extension / Add:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    This edit box and push button are used to add a file extension to the currently associated types. The the extension in
    the edit box and click the <emphasis role="italic">Add</emphasis> button. The association takes place immediately. The
    extension can be entered with or without the dot character.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">File Association List Boxes:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    There are two list boxes used to display file association file extensions. The <emphasis
    role="italic">Currently Associated</emphasis> list box shows all file extensions associate with the ooDialog Program file
    type. The <emphasis role="italic">Suggested Extensions</emphasis> list box is initially filled with a few suggested
    extensions. This is provided as a convenience for the user of the dialog.
  </para>
  <para>
    The list boxes can be in either dual column or single column mode. Recall that the operating system merges the file
    associations for all users and the current user. Because of this, if the ooDialog program file type is registered in
    either scope, (all users or the current user,) any associated file extension will work, no matter what scope it is
    associated in. This is reflected in the dual column mode. Every file extension in the currently associated list box is in
    effect for the user of the dialog. Each item in the list box has two columns. The first column shows the status for All
    Users, the second column shows the status for the Current User.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">+</emphasis></emphasis> character is used to show that the extension is
    associated in that scope. The <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">-</emphasis></emphasis> character is used to
    show that the extension is not registered in that scope.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <link linkend="figDualColumnExample">dual column</link> figure shows how to interpret the information displayed in
    the dialog. The Scope field shows that the task is currently configuring for All Users. The File Type is Registered field
    shows that the ooDialog Program file type is registered. The following fields show the file type is not registered
    for all users, but is registered for the current user. That is, the file type is not registered for the current scope of
    the task.
  </para>
  <para>
    The items in the currently registered list box show the <emphasis role="italic">ood</emphasis> extension is not registerd
    for all users / is registered for the current user, (<computeroutput>- * .ood</computeroutput>). The <emphasis
    role="italic">rxd</emphasis> extension is the inverse, registered for all users, not registered for the current user
    (<computeroutput>* - .ood</computeroutput>).
    <figure id="figDualColumnExample"><title>Dual Column Example</title>
    <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="images/oodDualColumnExample.jpg" scale="80" />
    </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    </figure>
  </para>
  <para>
    The <emphasis role="italic">Add</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Remove</emphasis> buttons between the two list
    boxes are used to move the selected extension in one list box to the other. If an extension is selected in the <emphasis
    role="italic">Suggest Extensions</emphasis> list box and the add button clicked, the extension is immediately registered
    in the current scope.
  </para>
  <para>
    Bear in mind that actions taken in the dialog are always only in relation to the current scope. For example in the
    figure, if the .ood extension in the currently registered list box is selected and the remove button is clicked, nothing
    will happen.  The .ood extension is not associated in the current scope, so it can not be un-associated. The .ood
    extension is associated for the current user, but the dialog is not working on that scope, so again that can not be
    changed.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Single / Double Column View:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    These two radio buttons are used to switch between dual column view, explained above, and single column view. In single
    column view the current registery values are shown only as they relate to the current scope. If the <link
    linkend="figDualColumnExample">dual column</link> figure were to be switched to single column view, it would appear as
    this:
    <figure id="figSingleColumnExample"><title>Single Column Example</title>
    <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="images/oodSingleColumnExample.jpg" scale="80" />
    </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    Note that the .ood extension is not associated for all users, so it does not appear in the currently associated list box.
    In some ways the single column view may be less confusing. But, for file associations, it does not present a true
    picture. The .ood extension is listed in the suggested extensions list box, but there is no real reason to associate it.
    Since .ood is associated for the current user, when the operating system merges the file associations for all users and
    the current user, it becomed assocaited in effect. Switching betweed the two views may be the best way to understand the
    current associations.
