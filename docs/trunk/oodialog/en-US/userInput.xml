<para>
  Capturing user input is normally an important part of any program. In one sense, the ooDialog framework is almost
  completely about capturing user input as that is the primary role of a dialog.
</para>
<para>
  The following table lists the general categories of user input in the Windows operating system, as described by the
  Windows documentation. Several of the categories have no current implmentation in ooDialog, or the implementation
  is scatterd throughout the <xref linkend="chpDialogObject"/> and dialog
  <xref linkend="chpDialogControlObject"/> classes. These categories are mentioned here for completeness. Future versions of
  ooDialog may be enhanced to address those categories.

<para>
  The ooDialog framework provides a number of easy to use dialogs and routines that obtain user input in common
  scenarios. These dialogs and routines allow programmers to include simple graphical elements in their Rexx
  applications and collect user input in a standard way. The public routines can be called with a single line of code
  and the standard dialogs can usually be executed with only two lines of code. This does not require the programmer to
  do much set up and makes them simple to work with.

<section id="clsBrowseForFolder" xreflabel="BrowseForFolder"><title>BrowseForFolder Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder class</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  A BrowseForFolder object represents the Windows <emphasis role="italic">Browse For Folder</emphasis> common dialog. The
  Windows operating system provides a number of common dialogs for use by applications to allow presenting the user with an
  unified generic method to do common tasks. The Browse For Folder dialog is specifically to allow the user to open or choose
  folders.
</para>


<section id="sctShellCOMConsiderations"><title>Shell / COM considerations</title>
<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder class</primary><secondary>Shell / COM considerations</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  The browse for folder dialog is part of the Windows Shell. Shell objects are implemented using COM (the component object
  model, a standard introduced by Microsoft.) The Windows Shell should not be confused with the Windows window manager, which
  is responsible for the windowing system in Windows. ooDialog is primarily concerned with, and deals with, the windowing
  system. However, to be able to deal with the full range of application needs in a modern Windows system, it becomes
  necessary to use more than just the windowing system. The need to provide a way for users to select or choose a folder is
  an example of needing more than just the window manager.
</para>
<variablelist>
  <varlistentry id="varItemIDList"  xreflabel="item ID list"><term><emphasis role="bold">Item ID List</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The Windows Shell identifies objects in the Shell using a structure called an item ID list. Files, folders, printers,
    remote computers all have an item ID list when working with them in the Shell. The ooDialog programmer does not really
    need to know about the details of these item ID lists. Although technically incorrect, the programmer can just think of
    them as <link linkend="defHandle">handles</link>. However, it is difficult to document the
    <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class without making some reference to an item ID list. For that
    purpose, this simple explanation of them is included.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>
  In general, the Rexx programmer can work with the <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class in the same way as
  working with any other ooDialog dialog classes. However, because the underlying Windows object is a COM object rather than
  the usual windowing system window, there are a few considerations the programmer needs to be aware of. The use of COM
  objects requirers that the COM library be initialized and released for <emphasis role="italic">each</emphasis> thread that
  a COM object is used in.
</para>
<para>
  Normally the Rexx programmer does not need to be much aware of threading and thread issues. However the COM requiement
  that the library be initialized and released on each thread changes that. The normal usage pattern for a browse for folder
  object would be:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
  <emphasis role="italic">Instantiate a <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> object.</emphasis>
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
  Configure the browse for folder object.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
  Show the dialog and get the user's selection.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
  As long as this is all done on one thread, there is no problem. The ooDialog framework initializes COM when the object is
  instantiated and releases COM when the underlying dialog is closed, when the <xref linkend="mthGetFolder"/> method returns.
  However, if the programmer wants, or needs, to implement a different usage pattern, then it becomes the programmer's
  responsibility to ensure that COM is initialized and released properly on each thread. The
  <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class provides the tools the programmer needs to do that. If COM is not
  initialized on a thread the browse for folder object is running on, then methods invoked on the object may fail. If COM is
  not released on a thread it <emphasis role="italic">was</emphasis> initialized on, then system resource leaks can occur.
</para>
<para>
  This is not that complicated and is not really that different than other areas of ooDialog concerning system resources. If
  the programmer wants to use a different font for a dialog control, the <xref linkend="mthSetFont"/> method will fail unless
  the programmer has first initialized a font. If the programmer initializes a font using the <xref
  linkend="mthCreateFontEx"/> method and does not release the font, then system resource leaks can ocurr. The only difference
  here is that this <emphasis role="italic">initialize / release</emphasis> cycle is on a per thread basis.
</para>
<para>
  The documentation for the individual attributes and methods of the <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class
  will make note of when the programmer needs to consider these threading issues when using the attribute or method. In
  addition, the <xref linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class provides an interface to the Browse For Folder dialog where
  the Rexx programmer does not need to be aware of COM.
</para>

<section id="sctSpecialFolderNames" xreflabel="Special Folder Names"><title>Special Folder Names</title>
<indexterm><primary>BrowseForFolder</primary><secondary>Special Folder Names</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>SimpleFolderBrowse</primary><secondary>Special Folder Names</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  Windows uses CSIDL (constant special item ID list) names to provide a unique system-independent way to identify special
  folders used frequently by applications. These folders may not have the same name or location on any given system. For
  example, the system folder may be <emphasis role="italic">C:\Windows</emphasis> on one system and <emphasis
  role="italic">C:\Winnt</emphasis> on another.
</para>
<para>
  In Windows Vista and later the CSIDL values have been replaced by Known Folder values, but for compatibility the CSIDL
  values still work. ooDialog does not yet support the known folder values, only the CSIDL names. Some of the methods of the
  <computeroutput>BrowseForFolder</computeroutput> class and the <xref linkend="clsSimpleFolderBrowse"/> class accept the
  CSIDL names listed below for arguments. Future enhancements to ooDialog may also accept the CSIDL names, so they are listed
  here in one place. The names are not case sensitive, but are otherwise spelled exactly as Microsoft does. Google can be
  used to research any of the names further. Only the names listed are recognized in ooDialog.

    The arguments are:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>title [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies a caption, or title, for the dialog. The Windows default title is <emphasis role="italic">Browse For
      Folder</emphasis>. If this argumentis used, the <xref linkend="atrDlgTitle"/> attribute is set using the value
      specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, the default ooDialog value, <emphasis role="italic">ooDialog Browse for Folder</emphasis>,
      is set for the <emphasis role="italic">dlgTitle</emphasis> attribute. To prevent the ooDialg default value from being
      used and have the Windows default used, set this argument to the <computeroutput>.nil</computeroutput> object, or to the empty string.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>banner [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies text to use for what Windows calls the <emphasis role="italic">banner</emphasis> for the dialog.  This string
      is displayed above the tree view control in the dialog box. The string can be used to specify instructions to the user.
      By default, Windows, does not display the banner and the area above the tree view is blank. If this argument is
      used, the <xref linkend="atrBanner"/> attribute is set to the value specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, the default ooDialog value, <emphasis role="italic">Select the folder needed</emphasis>,
      is set for the <emphasis role="italic">banner</emphasis> attribute. To prevent the ooDialg default value from being
      used and have the Windows default used, set this argument to the <computeroutput>.nil</computeroutput> object, or to
      the empty string.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>hint [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies text to use for a <emphasis role="italic">hint</emphasis> in the dialog. The hint is displayed below the
      bottom of the tree view control and above the bottom row of buttons of the dialog. By default, Windows does not display
      a hint, and the area where the hint would go is removed from the dialog. That is, the bottom row of buttons is placed
      directly below the tree view. If this argument is used, the <xref linkend="atrHint"/> attribute is set to the value
      specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, the default ooDialog value, <emphasis role="italic">If the needed folder does not exist it
      can be created</emphasis>, is set for the <emphasis role="italic">hint</emphasis> attribute. To prevent the ooDialg
      default value from being used and have the Windows default used, set this argument to the
      <computeroutput>.nil</computeroutput> object, or to the empty string.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>startDir [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies an initial selected folder for the dialog. By default, Windows opens the dialog with the top-most item in the
      tree view selected. If a start folder is specified, the folder is selected and, if needed, the tree view items are
      expanded and the tree view is scrolled so that the starting folder is visible in the tree view. If this argument is
      used, the <xref linkend="atrStartDir"/> attribute is set to the value specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      Testing indicates that the folder specified must be a fully qualified path name of an existing directory. If not, the
      operating system seems to just ignore it.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, the ooDialog framework sets the <emphasis role="italic">startDir</emphasis> attribute to
      the empty string. The causes Windows to use its default behaviour.

    these options after instantiations, set this attribute using a list of 0 or more of the following keywords, case is not

your subclass to add more dialog controls to the window. If you over-ride it, you
have to forward the message to the parent class by using the keyword super.

<section id="sctProgressDialog" xreflabel="A Progress Dialog"><title>A Progress Dialog</title>
<indexterm><primary>progress dialog implementation</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  ooDialog provides, as a standard dialog, an easy to use implementation of a progress dialog in the <xref
  linkend="clsProgressDialog"/> class. This implementation includes two small helper classes for the
  <computeroutput>ProgressDialog</computeroutput> class, the <xref linkend="clsInterruptible"/> and the <xref
  linkend="clsAlerter"/> classes. These classes are documented in this section.
</para>

<section id="clsProgressDialog" xreflabel="ProgressDialog"><title>ProgressDialog Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>ProgressDialog class</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  A <computeroutput>ProgressDialog</computeroutput> object is used to show a dialog containing a <xref
  linkend="clsProgressBar"/>, an optional message, an optional status line, and an optional <emphasis
  role="italic">Cancel</emphasis> button. The dialog shows the progress a lengthy task is making to the user. The optional
  components of the dialog, the message text, the status line, et., can be used to convey more information concerning the
  progrress, or the purpose of the dialog, to the user. The components can be used, or not used, according to the needs of
  the application.
</para>
<para>
  The progress dialog internally creates and sizes the components of the dialog, and the dialog itself, depending on how it
  is configured. For instance, if the dialog is configured to skip the message and status components, and the progress is not
  cancelable by the user, the dialog will consist of a progress bar only. The width of the dialog will either be a calculated
  width, default width, or a configured width. The height of the dialog will be the proper height to accomdatae the progress
  bar and other components, with margins. The layout of the dialog, from top to bottom, has a static control for the message
  at the top of the dialog, then a static control for the status line, then the progress bar, and finally a cancel button at
  the bottom right hand corner. The static message text, static status text, and progress bar controls are all the entire
  width of the dialog with an equal margin on each side.
</para>
<para>
  By default, the width of the dialog is calcualted based on the width of the message text. If there is no message, the width
  is calculated based on the width of a typical message. Or, the programmer can configure a width. The dialog maintains a
  minimum width that it will not be sized smaller than.
</para>
<para>
  The dialog object has a number of attributes that are used configure the appearance and behaviour of the dialog. The
  attributes all have default values and the progress dialog can be simply used <emphasis role="italic">as is</emphasis>, or
  the programmer can change the values of any or all of the attributes. The methods of the
  <computeroutput>ProgressDialog</computeroutput> class are used to start, update, and close the dialog.
</para>
<para>
  Normally, an application, shows the progress bar, starts its lengthy operation, and periodically, as it makes progress with
  the operation, it advances the progress bar position. When the operation finishes, the application ends the progress bar.
  With the <computeroutput>ProgressDialog</computeroutput> object, the programmer first configures the object by setting any
  attributes whose default values are not appropriate. The <xref linkend="mthBegin"/> method shows the progress bar. As the
  operation progresses, the programmer advances the progress bar position using the <xref linkend="mthIncrease"/> method. The
  <xref linkend="mthUpdateStatus"/> and <xref linkend="mthUpdateStatusText"/> methods can also be used to update the status
  line as progress is made, if desired. Finally, the <xref linkend="mthCompleteClsProgressDialog"/> and <xref
  linkend="mthEndNow"/> methods are used to end the dialog.
</para>
<para>
  One important aspect of performing a lengthy operation is whether the user can, or can not, cancel the operation once it is
  begun. By default, the progress dialog can not be canceled by the user, and no cancel button is present in the dialog. If
  the user tries to end the dialog using the Escape key, the Close menu item in the system menu, or the close button in the
  title bar, a message box is put up explaining that the operation is not done yet and can not be canceled. The dialog is not
  allowed to close. This default behaviour is changed throught the <xref linkend="atrCanCancel"/> attribute or through the
  <xref linkend="mthSetInterruptible"/> method. The use of an <xref linkend="clsInterruptible"/> object gives the programmer
  an elgant way of handling and controlling a user's request to cancel the operation.

  This attribute is set to true or false. By default, the width of the dialog is calculated based on the width of the message
  text, or the width of a generic message if the <xref linkend="atrMsgText"/> is not set. However, the programmer can change

<para>
  Reflects the number of lines that the area for the message text will take up. By default, <emphasis

  message. The height of 1 line is calculated from the height of the message. This doesn't work well for very long messages.

  <para>
    If the <emphasis role="italic">msgHeight</emphasis> attribute is greater than 1, the width of the dialog is calculated
    using the width of the default message <link linkend="atrMsgHeight">text</link>. The height of 1 line is always

    The height of the static control for the message is <emphasis role="italic">always</emphasis> set to <emphasis

    automatically wrap the text at word breaks. The control also honors new line character if they are embedded in the text.
  </para>
  <para>
    No attempt is made during the height and width calculations to try and determine if the assigned message text will fit in
    the static control or not if the <emphasis role="italic">msgHeight</emphasis> is set higher than 1. This means the
    programmer can increase the over all height of the dialog by increasing the message height, even if the height does not

  The <computeroutput>Interruptible</computeroutput> class defines an interface for an object that can be <emphasis

<para>
  The <computeroutput>SingleSelection</computeroutput> class presents a dialog that has a group of <link
  linkend="clsRadioButton">radio</link> buttons. The user can select only one item of the group, or cancel the dialog. The
  programmer can specify how many radio buttons are in the group, if they should be placed in one, or several, columns. The
  ooDialog framework internally handles all the layout of the controls of the dialog. This makes the dialog class very easy
  to use.
</para>

  The basic steps to user the <computeroutput>SingleSelection</computeroutput> are to instantiate the dialog using the
  <emphasis role="italic">new</emphasis> method, run the dialog using the <emphasis role="italic">execute</emphasis> method,

    When the <emphasis role="italic">execute</emphasis> method is invoked, the ooDialog framework, internally, does a number

    dialog controls such that none of the radio button labels, message, and title of the dialog are clipped.
  </para>
  <para>
    The one exception to this is if the programmer specifies the width of the radio button controls using the optional
    <emphasis role="italic">rbWidth</emphasis> argument in the <xref linkend="mthNewClsSingleSelection"/> method. In that
    case the width of the radio buttons is always set to what the programmer has specified. It is possible that the radio

  Causes a file selection dialog box to appear. File selection dialogs are used to allow the user to pick a file or set
  of files to open, or to pick a file to save to.

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Arguments:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The arguments are:
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>sel [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      This argument can be used to pre-select a file and / or have the open or save dialog start in a specified
     directory.
    </para>
    <para>
      This argument initializes the open or save dialog by selecting the specified file and placing its name in the
      <emphasis role="italic">File</emphasis> edit control of the dialog. In addition this argument can also be used to
      specify the initial directory (folder) the dialog opens in.
    </para>
    <para>
      When this argument contains no path information, then the <emphasis role="italic">File</emphasis> name edit
      control will contain the argument and the initial directory is determined by the operating system.  Which
      directory the operating system picks varies slightly between versions of Windows. But, in general, it will be a
      directory previously used in one of the Windows common dialogs, or a directory in the users My Documents folder.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the argument contains file name and path information, the initial directory will be determined by the path
      information and the <emphasis role="italic">File</emphasis> name edit control will contain the file information.
      When the selfile argument contains only path information and no file name information, i.e. the
      argument ends with a back slash <emphasis role="italic">\</emphasis>, then the initial directory will be that
      path and the <emphasis role="italic">File</emphasis> name edit control will be left blank.
    </para>
    <para>
      In cases where the argument contains incorrect path information, the initial directory is determined as if no path
      information had been supplied and the entire value of the argument is placed in the File name field.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis> that Windows treats normal wild card characters as valid for file names.
      Therefore, values such as <emphasis role="italic">C:\*.*</emphasis> or <emphasis
      role="italic">C:\Windows\*.exe</emphasis> are acceptable for this argument.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>parent [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      The window <xref linkend="defHandle"/> of a parent window for the open or save file dialog. Normally
      the programmer would use the handle of a dialog in her program. The operating system disables the parent window
      until the user closes the open or save dialog.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>msk [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      This argument contsists of pairs of filter strings where each of the filter strings is separated with a
      <computeroutput>'0'x</computeroutput> character and the pairs of strings within a filter are also seperated with a
      <computeroutput>'0'x</computeroutput> charatcter. The first string in each pair describes the filter and the
      second string in the pair is a list of file patterns to use for the filter. For instance, if the file pattern
      filter is <computeroutput>*.txt</computeroutput> then only files with the extension of
      <computeroutput>.txt</computeroutput> are displayed in the dialog. The file pattern can consist of any valid file
      name characters and and the asterisk (*) wildcard character. But the pattern can not contain any space characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      An example of how to construct this string is as follows:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

  delimiter = '0'x

  pair1 = "DLL Files (*.dll)"delimiter"*.dll"delimiter
  pair2 = "Class Files (*.cls)"delimiter"*.cls"delimiter

  filter = pair1 || pair2

]]>
</programlisting>
      To specify multiple file extension patterns for a single display string, use a semicolon to separate the patterns,
      for example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

  delimiter = '0'x

  pair1 = "Text Files (*.txt)"delimiter"*.txt;*.bak;*.doc"delimiter
  pair2 = "Class Files (*.cls)"delimiter"*.cls"delimiter

  filter = pair1 || pair2

]]>
</programlisting>

    </para>
    <para>
      The operating system does not change the order of the filters. In the open or save dialog the filters are
      dislpayed in the File Types combo box in the order specified in the <emphasis role="italic">mask</emphasis>
      argument.
    </para>
    <para>
      To have the dialog box not display any filters, use the empty string for this argument. The default filter string
      when this argument is omitted is:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

  delimiter = '0'x

  "Text Files (*.txt)"delimiter"*.txt"delimiter"All Files (*.*)"delimiter"*.*"delimiter

]]>
</programlisting>
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>type [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      A keyword specifying if the <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">File
      Save</emphasis> dialog is displayed. By default the <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis> is used. The
      keyword can be <emphasis role="italic">LOAD</emphasis> for the file open dialog or <emphasis
      role="italic">SAVE</emphasis> for the file save dialog. Only the first letter of the argument is needed and case
      is not significant.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the <emphasis role="italic">File Save</emphasis> dialog is not explicitly requested, the <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis>
      dialog is always presented.  For historic reasons this argument can also be <computeroutput>1</computeroutput> for
      the <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis> dialog or <computeroutput>0</computeroutput> for the
      <computeroutput>File Save</computeroutput> dialog.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>title [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      The window title for the save or open file idlaog. The default is <emphasis role="italic">Open a File</emphasis>
      or <emphasis role="italic">Save File As</emphasis>, depending on what is specified for the <emphasis
      role="italic">type</emphasis> argument.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>defExt [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      The default file extension. The <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">File
      Save</emphasis> dialog append this extension if the user does not type an extension.  Although this extension can
      be any length, the opererating system only uses the first 3 characters. The string must not include the <emphasis
      role="italic">.</emphasis> character.
    </para>
    <para>
      If this argument is omitted, <emphasis role="italic">txt</emphasis> is used. To prevent the operating system from
      appending an extension, the programmer should use the empty string for this argument.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>multi [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies if the <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis> dialog allows selection of multiple files. Normally,
      the open dialog allows the user to select one file only.  This can be changed by specifying the keyword <emphasis
      role="italic">MULTI</emphasis> for this option. Only the first letter is needed and case is not significant.
    </para>
    <para>
      This option is ignored for <emphasis role="italic">File Save</emphasis> dialogs. If the multiple file selection is
      enabled and the user selects multiple files, the returned result is then: <computeroutput>path file1 file2 file3
      ...</computeroutput>
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>sepChar [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies the separation character for the returned path and file names. This is needed for file names with blank
      characters. If this argument is omitted, the separation character is a blank. If the argument is specified, the
      returned path and file name string uses this separation character. For example, if you specify <emphasis
      role="italic">#</emphasis>  as the separation character, the return string might look as follows:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Return value:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    Returns the selected file name or 0 if the user cancels the dialog. Open file dialogs with multiple selection return
    <computeroutput>path file1 file2 file3 ...</computeroutput> when the user selects multiple files.
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Remarks:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    If the user changes directory with the <emphasis role="italic">File Open</emphasis> or <computeroutput>File
    Save</computeroutput> dialog, then the current directory of the Rexx program will be changed.  This is the behavior
    of the underlying Windows dialog, which is designed to work that way.  The ooDialog programmer should be aware of
    this behavior and insert code to change the directory back if that is needed. For example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
curdir = directory()
file = FileNameDialog("*.pdf", , "Adobe PDF Files"'0'x"*.pdf"'0'x)
call directory curdir

    In addition because of the way <xref linkend="defModalModeless"/> dialogs are implemented, it is possbile that those

<para>
  The SingleSelection function provides a shortcut to invoke a <xref linkend="clsSingleSelection"/> dialog. However, the
  <emphasis role="italic">labels</emphasis> argument is an array, rather than a stem as it is in the
  <computeroutput>SingleSelection</computeroutput> class.

  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Arguments:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The arguments are:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>msg [required]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      A text string that is displayed above the radio button group. Typically, the text would be used to give the user the
      purpose of the radio buttons, or to prompt the user as to what to do.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>title [required]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      A title, the caption bar text, for the dialog that will be invoked.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>labels [reuired]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      An array with indexes one through the number of radio buttons desired. The value for each index is the label for the
      corresponding radio button. For instance the value at index 2 of the array would be set to the label for the second
      radio button.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>preSel  [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
       This argument can be used to preselect, (that is to check,) one radio button. A value of 1 checks the first radio
       button, a value of 2 checks the second, and so on. If this argument is omitted, the first radio button is checked.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>rbWidth [optiona]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Specifies the width, in dialog units, of the radio button controls. If omitted, the width is calculated so that the
      longest label will not be clipped. If used, all radio buttons are set to this width without regard as to whether the
      label will be clipped or not.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term>max [optional]</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      The maximum number of radio buttons in one column. If there are more radio buttons than <emphasis
      role="italic">max</emphasis>, that is, if the <emphasis role="italic">labels</emphasis> argument has more indexes than
      the value of <emphasis role="italic">max</emphasis>, the radio buttons are positioned in columns. Each column will
      have <emphasis role="italic">max</emphasis> radio buttons and there will be as many columns as needed to display all
      the radio buttons.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Return value:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    If the user cancels the dialog, the empty string is returned. If the user closes the dialog with <emphasis
    role="italic">Ok</emphasis> the return is the index in the <emphasis role="italic">labels</emphasis> array of the
    selected radio button. 1 for the first radio button, 2 for the second radio button, 8 for the eighth radion button,
    etc., etc..
  </para>
  </listitem></varlistentry>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Remarks:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    When the <emphasis role="italic">SingleSelection</emphasis> routine is called, the ooDialog framework, internally, does
    a number of calculations to determine the optimal size of the dialog controls and dialog. The framework then positions
    all the dialog controls such that none of the radio button labels, message, and title of the dialog are clipped.
  </para>
  <para>
    The one exception to this is if the programmer specifies the width of the radio button controls using the optional
    <emphasis role="italic">rbWidth</emphasis> argument. In this case the width of the radio buttons is always set to what
    the programmer has specified. It is possible that the radio buttons will be clipped, but that is now the responsibility
    of the programmer.
  </para>

  <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">Example:</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
    The following example shows a dialog that contains a two-column radio button group. The sixth radio button (the button
    with the label Jun) is checked, (preselected.)

<para>The function returns 0, always, when the duration is non-negative.  When
the duration is less than 0, the function returns a reference to the
<computeroutput>TimedMessage</computeroutput> dialog object.  This is needed in
order for the programmer to manually dismiss the dialog.  Below are the same 3 <link

2:</emphasis></term>
<listitem><para>The following example shows an introductory window that displays
while an application is doing its time consuming start up routine.  Since this
start up process can vary in time depending on the individual system, the window
is set to display indefinitely.  When the start up process is finished, the
programmer dismisses the window and destroys the dialog manually.  Note how a
reference to the <computeroutput>TimedMessage</computeroutput> dialog is
returned.  The programmer only needs to use this to dismiss / destroy the dialog

and the dialog is destroyed automatically.
