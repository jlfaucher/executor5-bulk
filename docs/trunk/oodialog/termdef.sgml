<varlistentry><term id="resourceid">resource id</term>
<listitem><para>The identification number of a dialog resource. There are
several different types of dialog resources, menus, dialog controls, and bitmaps,
to name a few.  You assign IDs when you create the resource definition for
your dialog.  An ID can be either numerical (for example, 1) or symbolic (for
example, "IDOK").
</para>
<para>IDs must be unique for each resource of the same type.  Although two
resouces of different types may have the same ID, when using symbolic IDs with
ooDialog, it is advisable to give all resources unique numerical IDs.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term id="symbolicid">symbolic id</term>
<listitem><para>Defining a symbolic name for each numeric resource ID is often
useful in programs that work with resource IDs.  The symbolic name is then used
where ever a numeric resource ID is needed.  Symbolic names are easier to
remember than numeric IDs and can make the code easier to understand.
</para>
<para>The mechanism ooDialog provides for using symbolic IDs is the
<link linkend="constdir">ConstDir</link> attribute of the dialog classes.  This
is a directory object where the indexes are symbolic IDs and the item at each
index is the numerical value of the ID.  The symbolic IDs in the following table
are pre-defined by ooDialog and placed in the <computeroutput>ConstDir</computeroutput>
when an instance of a dialog class is created.

<varlistentry><term id="pounddefine">#define statement</term>
<listitem><para>Define statements are often used in the C and C++ langauages to
define symbolic names for numerical values.  Because of this, it is common in
Windows programs with dialogs to define symbolic names for resource IDs.  Most
Windows resource editors use symbolic IDs, (some to a limited degree, others
exclusively.)  Often the define statements are put in a header file so they are
available both to the resource compiler and to the program code.  The defines
take the form of: <computeroutput>#define symbolicName numericValue
</computeroutput> as in this example:</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

#define   ID_PUSHBUTTON1  413
#define   ID_EDIT1        511
#define   ID_LISTBOX1     602

]]>
</programlisting>
<para>When ooDialog parses a resource script or a header file and finds a define
statement, it will add the symbolic ID to the <link linkend="constdir">ConstDir</link>
directory object of the dialog.  Resource scripts are used by subclasses of the
<computeroutput>UserDialog</computeroutput> (see the <link linkend="h001613">Load</link>
method.)  All the ooDialog dialog classes accept a header file as an optional
parameter when a new instance of a dialog object is created.  (See for example
the <computeroutput>Init</computeroutput> method in the <link
linkend="h000025">BaseDialog</link> or <link linkend="h001531">UserDialog</link>
sections.) Symbolic IDs added to the <computeroutput>ConstDir</computeroutput>
can be used in any method of the ooDialog classes where a resource ID is needed.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term id="headerfile">header file</term>
<listitem><para>A common practice when programming applications in Windows that
use dialogs and dialog resources is to place symbolic defines in a separate
file.  These files often have a .h extension and are usually called header
files.  Windows resource editors often manage a header file for the symbolic IDs
automatically. (For instance Microsoft's dialog editor creates, writes, and
reads the resource ID header file completely on its own.  The user does not need
to take any action other than including the file in her program.)
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>handle</term>
<listitem><para>A unique reference to a Windows object assigned by the system.
It can be a reference to a dialog, a particular dialog item, or a graphic
object (pen, brush, font). Handles are required for certain methods; they
can be retrieved from the system when needed.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term id="dialogicon">dialog icon</term>
<listitem><para>The term <emphasis role="italic">dialog icon</emphasis> is used
in this documentation to refer to the icon that is displayed in the left hand
corner of the title bar of a dialog.  In Windows this is often called the
<emphasis role="italic">application</emphasis> icon.  The dialog icon is also
used for the Task Bar display and in the AltTab task switcher application.</para>
<para>The dialog icon for a specific dialog can be set when the dialog is run
using one of the execute methods.  See the <link linkend="h000048">Execute</link>
or <link linkend="popup">Popup</link> methods for example.  ooDialog provides four
pre-defined icons for use in dialogs.  Custom icons can be used by including the
icon in a binary (compiled) resource, a resource script, or by using the
<link linkend="addicon">AddIcon</link> method of the UserDialog.  The following
table shows the symbolic IDs of the pre-defined icons.  Their numeric IDs should
be considered reserved.  There is a fifth symbolic ID that represents the default
dialog icon.  This ID can always be used where a dialog icon ID is needed.

<listitem><para>Stores information about the graphic objects that are displayed, such
as bitmaps, lines, and pixels, and the tools used to display them, such as
pens, brushes, and fonts. A device context can be acquired for a dialog or
a button; it must be explicitly freed when the text or graphic operations
are completed.

<varlistentry><term>pixel</term>
<listitem><para>Individual addressable point within a window. VGA screens support 640

base unit to convert width and height of dialog boxes and controls from dialog
units to pixels and vice versa. The value of these base units depend on the
screen resolution and the active system font; they are stored in attributes
of the UserDialog class.

</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>color palette</term>
<listitem><para>An array that contains color values identifying the colors that can
currently be displayed or drawn on the output device.</para>
<para>Color palettes are
used by devices that can generate many colors but can only display or draw
a subset of them at a time. For such devices, Windows maintains a system palette to
track and manage the current colors of the device.</para>
<para>Applications do not
have direct access to this system palette. Instead, Windows associates
a default palette with each device context. Applications can use the colors
in the default palette.</para>
<para>The default palette is an array of color values
identifying the colors that can be used with a device context by default.
Windows associates the default palette with a context whenever an application
creates a context for a device that supports color palettes. The default palette
ensures that colors are available for use by an application without any further
action. The default palette typically has 20 entries (colors), but the exact
number of entries can vary from device to device.  The colors in the default
palette depend on the device. Display devices, for example, often use the
16 standard colors of the VGA display and 4 other colors defined by Windows.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term id="windowsdoc">Windows documentation</term>
<listitem><para>The term <emphasis role="italic">Windows
documentation</emphasis> is used throughout the ooDialog reference to refer to
the Windows Operating System documentation provided by Microsoft.  The
documentation is called the <emphasis role="bold">MSDN Library</emphasis>.  The
library is provided online for anyone to access. In addition, since May 2006,
Microsoft has also provided free of charge the ISO images of the library
installation program.  Anyone can download the ISOs, burn them to a CD and
install the library locally on their system.
</para>
<para>It is not necessary for the ooDialog programmer to know or understand the
underlying Windows API that ooDialog is built on.  However, as programmers write
more sophisticated ooDialog applications, it may prove helpful to look up
certain details in the MSDN Libray.  The information below is provided to help
the ooDialog programmer locate the MSDN Library, if they would like to.  All
things on the Internet change.  The URLs listed here are accurate at the time of
this writting.
</para>
<para>The online MSDN Library is currently located at:</para>
<para>http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx.</para>
<para>Directions to the downloadable ISO images of the MSDN Library have been
posted on this blog entry:</para>
<para>http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2006/07/26/678897.aspx</para>
<para>A Google search using: <computeroutput>"Rob Caron" General Downloads MSDN
Library</computeroutput> should also turn up the blog entry.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term id="platformsdk">Windows platform SDK</term>
<listitem><para>The <emphasis role="italic">Windows Platform SDK</emphasis> is
provided free of charge by Microsoft.  The SDK is not needed to write ooDialog
programs.  However, combining the use of the documentation in the MSDN Library
with the SDK allows very sophisticated ooDialog programs to be written.  In
general, the ooDialog framework takes care of the low-level details needed to
work with the Windows API.  However, there are a few generic ooDialog methods
that provide direct access to the Windows API.
</para>
<para>As an example, the <link linkend="h000141">AddUserMessage</link> method
allows the programmer to connect any Windows message sent to a dialog to a
method in his ooDialog class.  To use this method, the programmer would go to
the MSDN library to look up details on the message and message parameters he is
interested in.  He would then use the Platform SDK to determine the numeric
value of the Windows message and possibly the numeric values of its parameters.
</para>
<para>This link provides some good information on the Platform SDK in general
and also points the reader to where to get a SDK.
</para>
<para>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_SDK</para>
<para>Again, note that it is not at all necessary to obtain, or understand
details concerning, the Platform SDK.  This information is provided for those
programmers that have reached the point where they think a method like
<computeroutput>AddUserMessage</computeroutput> might help them and need some
direction as to how to how to go about using it.
