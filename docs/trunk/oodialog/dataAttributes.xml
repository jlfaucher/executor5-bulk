<section id="sctUnderstandingDataAttributes"><title>Understanding Data Attributes</title>
<indexterm><primary>dialog object</primary><secondary>understanding data attributes</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  This section contains methods for working with <emphasis role="bold">data attributes</emphasis>. It contains methods
  to create a connection between the underlying dialog control and an attribute of the Rexx dialog object, methods for
  <emphasis role="bold">getting</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">setting</emphasis> the <emphasis
  role="bold">data</emphasis>, and methods to deal with <emphasis role="bold">automatic data detection</emphasis>. The
  data attribute is used to reflect the <emphasis role="bold">value</emphasis> associated with the underlying dialog
  control. For instance, the value of an <link linkend="clsEdit">edit</link> control could be thought of as the text of
  the control.
</para>
<para>
  In order to better understand the data attribute methods, it is userful to first discuss this concept in general.
  During the <link linkend="sctHistory">original</link> development of ooDialog the abstraction used was that there were
  only two objects.  One was the Rexx dialog object and the other was the <link
  linkend="ovvUnderlying">underlying</link> system dialog that the user sees on the screen. Dialog controls were not
  thought of as objects, but rather as the <emphasis role="bold">data</emphasis> of the underlying dialog. In this
  abstraction, the <emphasis role="bold">value</emphasis> of the data was the <emphasis role="bold">state</emphasis> of
  the dialog control.
</para>
<para>
  For instance, a radio button can be either checked or not checked. Therefore, its value could be 0 (not checked) or 1
  (checked.) Thus the data of the radio button would be a 1 or a 0. Using this abstraction of two objects, the Rexx
  dialog and the underlying on screen dialog, then leads to the idea of exchanging, or transferring, the data between
  the two objects. Or, typically, getting and setting the data of the underlying dialog. To facilitate this exchange of
  data, for each <emphasis role="bold">data item</emphasis>, (a dialog control,) in the underlying dialog an attribute
  is added to the Rexx dialog object. This attribute is then used to transfer data between the Rexx dialog object and
  the underlying dialog control. The value of each data attribute is a single string which represents the state of the
  dialog control.
</para>
<para>
  The operation of <emphasis role="bold">connecting</emphasis> a dialog control is the action of creating the attribute
  (the data attribute) in the Rexx dialog object, and internally mapping the attribute to the specified dialog control
  in the underlying dialog. The operation of <emphasis role="bold">seting data</emphasis> then becomes the action of
  setting the state of the underlying dialog control to match the value of the corresponding attribute of the Rexx
  dialog object. The operation of <emphasis role="bold">getting data</emphasis> becomes the action of setting the value
  of the attribute in the Rexx dialog object to match the state of the corresponding dialog control in the underlying
  dialog.
</para>
<para id="paraAutomaticDataDetection">
  The term <emphasis role="italic">automatic data field detection</emphasis> is used for this process of creating and
  connecting data attributes. In addition to creating and connecting the data attributes, if automatic data field
  detection is on, when the underling dialog is created, the state of its controls are automatically set to the values
  of the data attributes. Likewise, when the dialog is closed, the values of the data attributes in the Rexx dialog are
  set to the state of their correspondaing controls in the underlying dialog.
</para>
<para>
  Automatic data detection is implemented in all three main classes of dialogs, the <link
  linkend="clsUserDialog">UserDialog</link>, <link linkend="clsResDialog">ResDialog</link>, and <link
  linkend="clsRcDialog">RcDialog</link>, and of course their subclasses. Automatic data detection can be turned on or
  off. By default it is <emphasis role="bold">on</emphasis>. The best way to turn automatic data field detection off is
  to over-ride the <link linkend="mthInitAutoDetection">initAutoDetection</link>() method in your class.
</para>
<para>
  Some dialog controls are not considered to be <emphasis role="italic">data</emphasis> and therefore data attributes
  are not created for those controls. (This is a quirk going back to the original implementation of of ooDialog.) The
  non-data controls are those, in general, that the user would not change or update in a dialog. <link
  linkend="clsButton">Push buttons</link>, <link linkend="clsGroupBox">group boxes</link>, and <link
  linkend="clsStatic">static</link> controls are all considered non-data controls. There are no data attribute methods
  for these controls.
</para>
<para>
  When automatic data detection is turned off, the programmer can use the <link
  linkend="sctConnectDataMethods">connect...</link> attribute methods to manually create and connect the data attribute
  for any control. However, with automatic detection off, the ooDialog framework will not set the state of the dialog
  controls to match the values of the connected attributes when the underlying dialog is created. Likewise, when the
  dialog ends the connected attributes of the Rexx dialog object are not updated to the state of the dialog controls.
  But, the programmer can use the <link linkend="mthSetData">setData</link>() and <link
  linkend="mthGetData">getData</link>() methods to do this herself.
</para>
<para>
  The implementation of automatic data detection in the three main classes of dialogs is slightly different in each
  class due to the differences in the classes:

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">UserDialog:</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      In a <link linkend="clsUserDialog">UserDialog</link> the <link linkend="sctConnectDataMethods">connect...</link>
      attribute methods are called automatically from the <link linkend="sctCreateMethods">create...</link> methods of the
      <computeroutput>UserDialog</computeroutput>. Each of the create... methods takes an optional argument that allows
      the programmer to specify the data attribute name. If that argument is omitted, the attribute name is <link
      linkend="sctDataAttributeNames">automatically</link> generated. This behavior is only when automatic data
      detection is on. When it is off, no data connection is made, even if the argument name is specified.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">RcDialog</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      A <link linkend="clsRcDialog">RcDialog</link> is actually a subclass of the
      <computeroutput>UserDialog</computeroutput>. Therefore, when automatic data detection is on, the connect...
      attribute methods are invoked automatically during the creation of each dialog control. The difference is that
      there is no option to specify the attribute name, the name is <emphasis role="bold">always</emphasis> generated
      automatically.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">ResDialog</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      With a <link linkend="clsResDialog">ResDialog</link> the data connections are made after the underlying dialog is
      created. Internally, the numeric resource ID and text of each control in the dialog is determined. Then, a data
      attribute for each control is created and connected. Again, there is no way for the programmer to specify the data
      attribute name, it is always automatically constructed.
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  Obviously, the data attribute itself can not be accessed until it is created. For each type of class this is at a
  subtly different point in the life cycle of the dialog.
</para>
<para>
  In summary: When automatic data field detection is on, the ooDialog framework automatically creates an attribute in
  the dialog object for each dialog control in the underlying dialog. The attribute is connected to the control through
  an internal mapping maintained by the framework. Once the connection is made, it can be used to get or set the
  <emphasis role="italic">data</emphasis> of the control.  The data of a control is a string representation of the
  control's state. When each underlying dialog is created, the state of all its controls is set to the value of its
  connected data attribute. When the underlying dialog is closed by the user, the process is reversed. Each data
  attribute is updated to reflect the state of the dialog control when the dialog was closed. For the most part, the
  name of the data attribute is generated automatically by the framework. When automatic data field detection is off,
  none of this is done, but there are methods the programmer can use to manually do the same things.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sctDataAttributeNames"><title>Data Attribute Names</title>
<indexterm><primary>data attribute names</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>dialog object</primary><secondary>data attribute names</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  Except when the programmer explicitly names the data attribute in one of the <link
  linkend="sctConnectDataMethods">connect...</link> methods, or one of the <link
  linkend="sctCreateMethods">create...</link> methods of the <computeroutput>UserDialog</computeroutput>, the data
  attribute names are generated internally. Even when the name is explicitly specified by the programmer, if the name is
  not a valid method name or is a duplicate method name, the attribute name is generated internally. The rules for how
  the attribute names are generated can be a little difficult to grasp. The following list is intended to be complete
  description of the rules in all circumstances.

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry id="termConnectAutoNames"><term><emphasis role="bold">connect... data attribute methods:</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      When the programmer uses one of the <link linkend="sctConnectDataMethods">connect...</link> methods, the attribute
      name can be omitted, or the name specified could not be valid. For these cases, the internally generated name is
      created in this way:
    </para>
    <para>
      If the name is omitted, then the name is created by prepending <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> with the
      resource ID argument. Recall that the resource ID argument can possibly be a symbolic ID. Example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  -- The attribute name will be DATA202
  self~connectEdit(202)

  -- The attribute name will be DATAIDC_EDIT_FNAME
  self~connectEdit(IDC_EDIT_FNAME)
]]>
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Whether the attribute name was specified or not, before the attribute is actually added to the dialog object, the
      name is checked to see that it is a valid method name, that it is not the empty string, and not a duplicate of an
      already existing method name in the dialog. When the check fails, the name is created by prepending
      <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> with the <emphasis role="bold">numeric</emphasis> value of the
      resource ID argument. This is true even when the id argument is specified as a symbolic ID. Example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  self~constDir[IDC_EDIT_FNAME] = 344

  -- The attribute name will be DATA202
  self~connectEdit(202, "COPY")

  -- The attribute name will be DATA344
  self~connectEdit(IDC_EDIT_FNAME, 'FNAME+ADDRESSBOOK')

]]>
</programlisting>
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry id="termCreateAutoNames"><term><emphasis role="bold">UserDialog create... methods:</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      In the typical <computeroutput>UserDialog</computeroutput>all cotrols are added to the dialog by using one of the
      <link linkend="sctCreateMethods">create...</link> methods. This is similar to using one of the connect... methods.
      The attribute name argument can be omitted, or the specified attribute name might not be valid. For these cases,
      the internally generated name is created in this way:
    </para>
    <para>
      If the name is omitted, and the dialog control is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> a check box or radio
      button, then the name is created by prepending <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> with the numeric value of the
      resource ID argument. Example:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  self~constDir[IDC_EDIT_FNAME] = 344

  -- The attribute name will be DATA344
  self~createEdit(344, 10, 10, 100, 12, "AUTOSCROLLH MULTILINE")

  -- The attribute name will be DATA344
  self~createEdit(IDC_EDIT_FNAME, 10, 10, 100, 12, "AUTOSCROLLH MULTILINE")
]]>
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      If the name is omitted and the dialog control <emphasis role="bold">is</emphasis> a check box or radio button,
      then the name is created from the text of the <emphasis role="bold">label</emphasis> of the button. First all
      spaces, ampersands, and colons, if any, are removed from the label. The result is used for the attribute name.
      Examples:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  self~constDir[IDC_CHK_LN] = 200
  self~constDir[IDC_CHK_MAIL] = 201
  self~constDir[IDC_CHK_RECEIPT] = 202

  -- The attribute name will be USELASTNAME
  self~createCheckBox(IDC_CHK_LN, 10, 10, 80, 12, "GROUP", "&Use last name")

  -- The attribute name will be MAILITEM
  self~createCheckBox(IDC_CHK_MAIL, 10, 27, 80, 12, "RBUTTON RIGHT", "Mail item:")

  -- The attribute name will be RECEIPT
  self~createCheckBox(IDC_CHK_RECEIPT, 10, 45, 80, 12, , "Receipt")
]]>
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Whether the attribute name was specified or generated by the framework, the name is always checked to see if it is
      the empty string, not a valid method name, or a duplicate of an already existing method name in the dialog.  When
      the check fails, then the name is created by prepending <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> with the <emphasis
      role="bold">numeric</emphasis> value of the resource ID argument. This is true even when the id argument is
      specified as a symbolic ID. Examples:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  self~constDir[IDC_EDIT_CLASS] = 344
  self~constDir[IDC_CHK_DEFAULTNAME] = 201
  self~constDir[IDC_CHK_COPY] = 202

  -- The attribute name will be DATA344 (CLASS is an existing method name.)
  self~createEdit(IDC_EDIT_CLASS, 10, 10, 100, 12, "AUTOSCROLLH MULTILINE", "Class")

  -- The attribute name will be DATA201 (defaultName is an existing method name.)
  self~createCheckBox(IDC_CHK_DEFAULTNAME, 10, 27, 80, 12, , "Default Name")

  -- The attribute name will be DATA202
  self~createCheckBox(IDC_CHK_COPY, 10, 45, 80, 12, , "&Copy")

]]>
</programlisting>
    </para>
    </listitem></varlistentry>
    <varlistentry><term><emphasis role="bold">ResDialog:</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      For a <computeroutput>ResDialog</computeroutput>, the attribute names are always generated by the ooDialog
      framework, there is no way for the programmer to specify the name. When the underlying dialog is created, the
      numeric resource ID and the text of all the dialog controls is collected. For <emphasis
      role="bold">each</emphasis> control, the data attribute is created using the <emphasis role="bold">text</emphasis>
      of the control.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis> this important detail: every dialog control can have text associated with it
      when compiled from a <link linkend="defResourceScript">resource script</link>. Although for many controls, text is
      not usually associated with them, it is always possible that they do have text.
    </para>
    <para>
      The text of the control has all spaces, ampersands, and colons removed. The result is checked as usual. If it is
      the empty string, or not a valid method name, or a duplicate of an existing method name, then the attribute name
      is changed to <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> prepended to the resource ID. The attribute name then follows
      the pattern(s) already seen. Examples:

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  -- For an edit control with resource ID 344 and no associated text:
  DATA344

  -- For a check box with resource ID 400 and a label of "Compile":
  COMPILE

  -- For a radio button with resource ID 200 and a label of "&Copy":
  DATA200

  -- For a tree view with resource 320 and text associated of "C: Drive"
  CDRIVE

  -- Same tree view with no text assoicate, (the usual case):
  DATA320

  -- etc..

    <listitem>
    <para>
      Although a <computeroutput>RcDialog</computeroutput> is actually a subclass of a
      <computeroutput>UserDialog</computeroutput> and the dialog controls are added to the dialog <link
      linkend="ovvDialogTemplate">template</link> through the <link linkend="sctCreateMethods">create...</link> methods,
      the generated attribute names have a different pattern. If the resource ID of the control in the <link
      linkend="defResourceScript">resource script</link> file is a symbolic ID, then the attribute name will be the
      symbolic ID. On the other hand, if the resource ID is numeric in the resource script file, then the attribute name
      will be <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> prepended to the numeric ID. Example:

    </para>
    <para>
      However, as always, the attribute name is checked to be a valid method name, not the empty string, and not a
      duplicate of an existing method name. If the resource script file is valid, it can not be the empty string.
      Usually, programmers do not name their symbolic IDs in a fashion that would conflict with an existing method name,
      but there is no reason why they could not. If the check fails, then the attribute name will once again be
      <computeroutput>DATA</computeroutput> prepended to the <emphasis role="bold">numeric</emphasis> value of the
      resource ID.  Example:

<indexterm><primary>data attribute problems</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>dialog object</primary><secondary>data attribute problems</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  In the author's mind, there are a number of problems with the whole data attribute concept. In no particular oder,
  some of them are brought up here.
</para>
<para>
  The abstraction that there are only two objects, the Rexx dialog object and the underlying operating system dialog, is
  a little outdated. In this abstraction, the state of a dialog control can only be represented by a single string, and
  the state must be transferred back and forth through the dialog object. The abstraction works somewhat for simple
  controls like a check box, a radio button, or an edit control. However it quickly starts to break down with more
  complex controls like tree views and list views. Indeed, when the more complicated controls were added to ooDialog,
  there were no get and set data methods implemente for them.  There is no <emphasis
  role="italic">getTreeViewData</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">setListViewData</emphasis> method.
</para>
<para>
  A more flexible abstraction is that everything is an object, that all the dialog controls are objects. In this
  abstraction, the state of a dialog control is set or queried directly through methods of the dialog control object.
  Current development in ooDialog is done using this abstraction.
</para>
<para>
  Presumably the automatic data field detection was done to make things easier for the Rexx programmer. However, the
  whole process is actually quite confusing. The data attributes themselves are not visible in the program, which often
  makes it difficult to read and understand a program. When the attribute names are generated automatically, it is often
  quite difficult to know exactly what the name is.
</para>
<para>
  With auto detection on, the states of the dialog controls are set to the data (values) of the corresponding data
  attributes. This is done <emphasis role="bold">after</emphasis> <link linkend="mthInitDialog">initDialog</link>() is
  invoked. The consequence of this is that, if the programmer explicitly sets the state of the dialog controls in the
  <emphasis role="italic">initDialog</emphasis>() method, the ooDialog framwork will then <emphasis
  role="bold">reset</emphasis> the state of all the dialog controls afterwards. This can be disconcerting to the
  programmer if automatic data field detection is not understood.

  <para>
    In the following example, the edit control with symbolic resource ID IDC_EDIT is connected to the Rexx dialog
    object's <emphasis role="italic">NAME</emphasis> attribute. The connection process creates the data attribute. The
    string: <emphasis role="italic">Put your name here</emphasis> is assigned to the newly created data attribute. When
    the dialog is executed, the underlying edit control is manually synchronized with the attribute. This has the
    effect of setting the text of the edit control to the value of the attribute, which is the string, Put your name
    here.
  </para>
  <para>
    When the dialog is closed by the user with an <emphasis role="italic">ok</emphasis> command, the data attribute is
    manually synchronized with the state of the edit control. The state of an edit control is defined to be the text
    within the control. This synchronization has the effect of copying whatever text is in the edit control to the data
    attribute. Then, when the dialog has terminated, the name the user entered is displayed. (Of course the user may not
    have entered her name. What is displayed is whatever the text in the edit control was when the dialog was closed.)

<para>
  The <emphasis role="italic">getDataStem</emphasis>() method is the reverse of the <link
  linkend="mthSetDataStem">setDataStem</link>() method.  The method gets the <emphasis role="italic">data</emphasis> of
  all the dialog controls in the underlying dialog that have been connected to a <link
  linkend="sctUnderstandingDataAttributes">data attribute</link> of the Rexx dialog object. The data of each control is
  copied to the specified stem.
</para>
<para>
  A stem index for each  connected control is set.  The stem index is the numeric ID for the control.  The value at that
  index is the data of the matching dialog control.  In addition, if the <link linkend="atrConstDir">constDir</link>
  directory has a symbolic ID for the numeric ID of the control, a stem index of the symbolic ID is also set.  This of
  course only works reliably if the Rexx programmer uses unique numeric IDs for all resouces.

    The return will be the string value of the control data. This is dependent on the type of the control. For an edit

  <listitem>
  <para>
    If the control has not been previously connected to a data attribute, the implementation of this method assumes the
    control is an edit control and returns the text of the control. Since all windows have text value, which may be the
    empty string, this is okay. However this is not the intent of this method. The method is intended to only be used
    with controls connected to a data attribute.
  </para>
  <para>
    It appears that the original intent of this method was to be used for controls such as tree views, list views, tabs,
    etc.. When these controls were added to ooDialog, no corresponding getTreeViewData(), getProgressBarData(), etc.,
    methods were implemented. The generic <emphasis role="italic">getControlData</emphasis>() method works for all
    connected controls, but it works best if the programmer knows the type of control.

    A better method to use, if the programmer is insistent on thinking in terms of data attributes, is probably to use

<listitem><para>Assume that three methods are connected to push buttons. The SetToDefault
method overrides the value in the Windows dialog entry line 234 with the
value 256 but does not change its associated attribute. Using setEditData
has the same effect as a change to the entry line made by the user. The associated
attribute in the Object Rexx object (<computeroutput>DATA234</computeroutput>) still has the original
value. Thus it is possible to undo the changes or confirm them.
