<chapter id="chpBaseObjects"><title>Base Classes and Mixin Classes</title>
<indexterm><primary>Base classes</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Base Mixin classes</primary></indexterm>
<para>
   ooDialog programs primarily deal with dialog and dialog control objects. The top-level objects in the programs, say
   an <link linkend="clsUserDialog">user dialog</link> or a <link linkend="clsButtonControl">button control</link> are
   actually composed of a number of base objects and / or mixin classes. Since all dialog objects contain the methods of
   their component classes, this documentation treats the dialog object as a whole in <link
   linkend="chpDialogObject">The Dialog Object</link> chapter to make it easier to grasp the concepts.
</para>
<para>
  The PlainBaseDialog inherits from the WindowBase mixin class.  The WindowBase mixin class implements methods that are
  common to all windows.  Since both dialogs and dialog controls are windows, the <link
  linkend="clsDialogControl">DialogControl</link> class also inherits from WindowBase.
</para>

<para> The PlainUserDialog class subclasses from PlainBaseDialog class and provides all the methods that
  normally are required to execute a dialog that is either created dynamically or loaded from a resource script (.RC).
  Its purpose is to provide a simpler class that can be used for ordinary user interfaces, like the <link
  linkend="sectStandardDialogs">standard dialogs</link>. The ooDialog programmer can subclass from the PlainUserDialog
  to produce straighforward, uncomplicated user interfaces.
</para>
<para>
  The more advanced dialog classes, <link linkend="clsResDialog">ResDialog</link>, <link
  linkend="clsRcDialog">RcDialog</link>, <link linkend="clsUserDialog">UserDialog</link>, subclass the
  <link linkend="chpDialogObject">BaseDialog</link> class. The BaseDialog class subclasses PlainBaseDialog,
  and like PlainBaseDialog should be considered an abstract class. BaseDialog inherits from the
  WindowExtensions and DialogExtensions mixin classes. These classes implement methods that cover
  asynchronous dialog execution, scroll bar support, resizing and repositioning, bitmaps, graphics
  (device context related methods), scrolling text, and menus (action bars).  The ResDialog, RcDialog,
  UserDialog classes, and their subclasses, allow the programmer to produce very sophisticated graphical
  user interfaces.
</para>

<section id="clsPlainBaseDialog"><title>PlaingBaseDialog</title>
<indexterm><primary>PlainBaseDialog Class</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  PlainBaseDialog is the base class of all dialog classes in the ooDialog framework.  It implements
  methods that are common to every dialog.  PlainBaseDialog should be considered an abstract class.
  Although, a programmer could instantiate a new PlainBaseDialog object, the class does not implement all
  the methods that are needed to execute a dialog. Therefore, not much can be done with a simple
  PlainBaseDialog object.  The ooDialog programmer uses subclasses of PlainBaseDialog to actually create
  and execute a real dialog.
</para>
</section>

<section id="clsWindowBase"><title>WindowBase Mixin Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>WindowBase Class</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  WindowBase is a mixin class with methods that are common to all windows.  It is inherited by both
  dialog and dialog control classes.
</para>
<para>
  The instance methods implemented by the WindowBase class are listed here as a cross reference. The
  methods are fully documented in other sections of this book. Each method listed has a link to the full
  documentation for that method and an accurate syntax diagram.
</para>
<para>
  Both the PlainBaseDialog and the DialogControl classes inherit the WindowBase class.  Since the
  PlainBaseDialog is the base class for all dialogs and the DialogControl class is the base class for all
  controls, every dialog object and every dialog control object have the instance methods listed here.
</para>

&windowBaseCommon;

</section>

<section id="clsWindowExtensions"><title>WindowExtensions Mixin Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>WindowExtensions Class</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  WindowExtensions is a mixin class with methods that are common to all windows.  As the class name
  implies, it is an extension of the WindowBase class, providing more sophisticated window methods.
  It is inherited by both dialog and dialog control classes.
</para>
<para>
  The instance methods implemented by the WindowExtensions class are listed here as a cross reference.
  The methods are fully documented in other sections of this book. Each method listed has a link to the
  full documentation for that method and an accurate syntax diagram.
</para>
<para>
  Both the BaseDialog and the DialogControl classes inherit the WindowBase class.  The DialogControl
  class is the base class for all controls.  Therefore, every dialog control object and every dialog
  object that is a descendent class of the BaseDialog have the instance methods listed here.
</para>

<section id="clsPlainUserDialog"><title>PlainUserDialog Class (Deprecated)</title>
<indexterm><primary>Deprecated</primary><secondary>PlainUserDialog</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  This class is <link linkend="ovvDeprecated">deprecated</link>. The ooDialog framework <link
  linkend="ovvHistory">no longer</link> makes a distinction between a plain user dialog and an <link
  linkend="clsUserDialog">user dialog</link>. Directly subclass the <emphasis role="italic">Userdialog</emphasis>
  instead of the <emphasis role="italic">PlainUserDialog</emphasis>.
