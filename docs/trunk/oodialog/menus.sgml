<chapter id="menuclasses"><title>StaticControl Class</title>
<indexterm><primary>Menus</primary></indexterm>

<note><title>This documentation is preliminary and subject to change</title>
<para>
  The menu related classes are new to ooDialog in ooRexx version 4.0.0.  These classes are being
  documented and made available in the hopes that the users of ooDialog will help in refining the
  usability of the classes.  Because of this, it is possible that some methods and / or arguments to
  methods may have slight changes to them in future versions of ooDialog.
</para></note>

<para>
  Menus are lists of items that specify options for an application.  Groups of related options are
  usually placed in submenus.  Clicking a menu item either opens a submenu or causes the application
  to carry out a command.
</para>
<para>
  Menus are arranged as a hierarchy. A <emphasis role="italic">menu bar</emphasis> is the top of the
  hiearchy for menus attached to an application window.  The menu bar will containa a list of
  <emphasis role="italic">menus</emphasis>, and menus can contain <emphasis
  role="italic">submenus</emphasis>.  Menu bars are often called <emphasis
  role="italic">top-level</emphasis> menus, while the menus and submenus are also known as
  <emphasis role="italic">pop-up</emphasis> menus.
</para>
<para>
   A menu <emphasis role="italic">item</emphasis> either carries out a command or opens a submenu.
   Menu items that do not open a submenu are called <emphasis role="italic">command</emphasis> items
   or simply commands.
</para>
<para>
  The Menu related classes all require the class definition file
  <computeroutput>ooDialog.cls</computeroutput>:
</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
::requires "ooDialog"
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>
  Use the getStaticControl method (see <link linkend="getstaticcontrol">getStaticControl</link>) to
  retrieve an object of the StaticControl class. To use this method, the static control must have a
  positive ID.
