<para>
  The primary purpose of ooTest is to throughly test the ooRexx interpreter and its distribution
  pacakages.  In general, to throughly test software involves automating as much as possible of the
  testing.  The ooTest framework provides the foundation for automatically executing tests.  It currently
  contains little or no components that would aid in automating the writing of tests.
</para>
<note><title>Note</title><para>
  This document is written for the 4.0.0 and later versions of ooTest.  It makes no effort to cover the
  3.2.0 verison of ooTest, or explain any differences between the 3.2.0 and 4.0.0 versions.  There are
  differences.
</para></note>
<para>
  ooTest also contains all the tests written to date to that the ooRexx team uses to test ooRexx.  This
  makes ooTest itself more than just a framework.  It is the sum of the tests themselves, the framework
  to write the tests, and any other components used in the over all process of testing the ooRexx
  package.
</para>
<para>
  This document serves as a reference to the different components of ooTest.  It explains how to execute
  the tests, intepret the results, and gives some guidence in writing new tests.  The document does not
  have much detail on how to obtain ooTest or set it up.  That is provided in numerous places.  And,
  indeed there is very little set up involved in ooTest.  It is merely a matter of placing the ooTest
  files on the system used to test.

<indexterm><primary>ooTest</primary>
<secondary>history</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>ooTest</primary>
<secondary>foundation</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  ooTest started out as ooRexxUnit.  ooRexxUnit is a <emphasis role="italic">generic</emphasis> testing
  framework designed to serve as a unit testing framework for anyone to use to test their Rexx programs.
  It is patterned after jUnit and originally strove to emulate jUnit as closely as possible.  As a
  publicly released piece of software it was constrained by typical needs, such as providing backward
  compatibility, limiting changes that require the user to make changes to their exisiting testing
  efforts, etc..
</para>
<para>
  Over time it became apparent that the constraints of ooRexxUnit were a hinderance to the ooRexx testing
  effort.  Therefore, the ooTest framework was put in place.  ooTest sits on top of ooRexxUnit, but it is
  not designed to be a generic testing framework, does not guarentee backward compatibility, and does not
  strive to closely emulate jUnit.  The idea behind this was to leave ooRexxUnit as a generic testing
  framework for any one to use, and focus the ooTest framework on specificaly testing ooRexx.
</para>
<para>
  However, because of its history, ooTest is conceptualy similar to jUnit.  If you understand jUnit
  concepts, you will have little trouble understanding ooTest.  The main difference is that jUnit is
  primarily a unit testing framework, while ooTest is primarily an automation framework, that heavily
  supports unit testing.
</para>
<para>
  From the perspective of writing test cases, ooTest is very jUnit-like.  The terminology of ooTest is
  very similar to that of jUnit.  ooTest uses test cases, test case classes, test suites, test results,
  test runners, and asserts, just as jUnit does.  ooTest uses the same design patterns that jUnit uses.
  Hardly surprising as ooRexxUnit was modeled after jUnit.  jUnit has generated many tutorial and primer
  types of documentation on the Internet.  Google 'jUnit tutorial' or 'jUnit primer' and browse some of
  the simpler ones.  This will quickly give you a grasp of ooTest test cases.

<para>
  ooTest is a way of writing defined repeatable tests, collecting and storing the tests, and executing
  all or some of those tests, now and in the future.  With ooTest, all tests are to test the ooRexx
  interpreter and its distribution package.  The purpose of a test is to demonstrate that some facet of
  the interpreter works, both now and at the next point in time the test is executed.  To do this ooTest
  uses objects and the following loosely discusses these objects and how they fit together.

<secondary>execution</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
  The execution of all the tests in the test suite is currently driven by one Rexx program,
  <computeroutput>testOORexx.rex</computeroutput>.  This program has an extensive set of options that
  allow the execution of all the tests, a single test, or subsets of the tests.  As is all of ooTest, the
  program is platform independent and runs on all platforms where ooRexx is available.
</para>
<para>
  When run, testOORexx sets up the environment, gathers up the tests to be executed, executes them, and
  prints out the statistics for the test run.
</para>
<para>
  There is nothing preventing the use of other driver programs with the tests for the interpreter.  It is
  merely that no one has written one.  In particular, a GUI test driver would be nice and relatively easy
  to produce.  One approach would be for the GUI driver to present the interface and then call testOORexx
  under the covers to do the actual work.
</para>

<section id="useTestOORexx"><title>Using testOORexx.rex</title>
<indexterm><primary>testOORexx</primary>
<secondary>starting</secondary></indexterm>

<para>
  testOORexx.rex is a command line program. It is designed to, and should be, run from a console window.
  Starting testOORexx.rex is the same as starting any Rexx program.  On Windows, with a default install
  of ooRexx where <computeroutput>.rex</computeroutput> has a file association with the interpreter, you
  can simply type testOORexx.  For example:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\ooTest>testOORexx
]]>
</programlisting>
  On an unix-like system, testOORexx would typically be started like this:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
[miesfeld@falcon]# ./testOORexx.rex
]]>
</programlisting>
  Of course testOORexx can always be started this way:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\ooTest>rexx testOORexx.rex

[miesfeld@falcon]# rexx testOORexx.rex
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  Usually you would start testOORexx in the root directory of ooTest.  I.e., in the directory that
  contains <computeroutput>testOORexx.rex</computeroutput>.  However, testOORexx.rex is designed to run
  from any location on the local machine's file system.  The main purpose of this is to allow a developer
  to execute the test suite from within their build directory.  But, as the following example
  illustrates, testOORexx can be run from anywhere on the system:
<programlisting>

  Although running testOORexx will correctly set up the PATH to executed the tests, some people may
  prefer to change the path.  This will allow running testOORexx from anywhere without having to type in
  the complete path name of testOORexx, such as <computeroutput>C:\ooTest\testOORexx</computeroutput>.
  In addition, on Windows testOORexx is able to completely set up the environment for executing all the
  tests, but on unix-like systems the library path can not be set.  On the unix-like systems, the library
  path <emphasis role="bold">must be</emphasis> set prior to executing any test requiring one of the TODO
  external binaries ADD LINK. Two small utility scripts, <computeroutput>setTestEnv.bat</computeroutput>
  and <computeroutput>setTestEnv.sh</computeroutput> are provided to handle these chores.  On Windows:
<programlisting> <![CDATA[
C:\ooTest>setTestEnv ]]>
</programlisting>
  On a unix-like system be sure to source the utility script:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
[miesfeld@falcon]# . ./setTestEnv.sh
Setting env for Linux
[miesfeld@falcon]#
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
  Another reason to use the utility scripts is that this allows a TODO test group ADD LINK to be run as a
  stand alone Rexx program from its current directory.  This is sometimes useful when first developing a
  set of test cases in a test group.  For example:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\ooTest\ooRexx\base\class>rexx Array.testGroup

Interpreter:     REXX-ooRexx_4.0.0(MT) 6.03 21 Jun 2009
Addressing Mode: 64
ooRexxUnit:      2.0.0_3.2.0    ooTest: 1.0.0_4.0.0

Tests ran:           101
Assertions:          8007
Failures:            0
Errors:              0
Skipped files:       0

Test execution:     00:00:00.469000


C:\ooTest\ooRexx\base\class>
]]>
</programlisting>
  Executing a test group as a stand alone program is not possible unless the ooTest root directory is in
  the path because the interpreter will not be able to find the
  <computeroutput>ooTest.frm</computeroutput> file:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
C:\ooTest\ooRexx\base\class>rexx Array.testGroup
    54 *-* ::requires 'ooTest.frm' -- load the ooRexxUnit classes
Error 43 running C:\ooTest\ooRexx\base\class\Array.testGroup line 54:  Routine not found
Error 43.901:  Could not find routine "ooTest.frm" for ::REQUIRES

C:\ooTest\ooRexx\base\class>
]]>
</programlisting>
<note><title>Note</title><para>
  As a reminder, on unix-like systems, sourcing <computeroutput>setTestEnv.sh</computeroutput> is a
  requirement when tests using the TODO external binaries ADD LINK will be executed.  Unless of course
  the library path is manually set by some other means.
