<chapter id="chapThree"><title>Re-Structuring the Code</title>
<indexterm><primary>code structure</primary></indexterm>
<para>
  Our current code is hopeless. It works - but only because it's so very simple.
  The problem is its design - its structure. There are three quite different concerns that must be separated:
  the UI including both presentation and user action; the data (in our case a set of text strings);
  and the "business". What's the business of this code? It's picking out (from the data) the
  particular text to be displayed. In the next exercise, these concerns are separated,
  with no change as far as the user's concerned.
</para>
<para>
  The three areas of concern have a close relationship with the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
  concept (see
  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model-view-controller"><citetitle>Model-View-Controler</citetitle></ulink>)
  The view is the UI, the text data is the model, and picking out which to have displayed is the controller.
  This model works well for PC-resident applications, but, by the way, does not easily scale to distributed systems, where
  a couple of additional architectural concepts are required (see, for example,
  "Business Component Factory" by Peter Hurzum and Oliver Sims).
  It does scale down, however, and can be applied within the Windows GUI infrastructure.
</para>
<para>
  But why have three areas for our simple program? Surely picking out a text string at random can be part of
  the code handling the data? Perhaps a method on a data or model class? A good question.
  But there's a useful architectural rule that says that model objects should have a CRUDLV interface.
  CRUDLV (pronounced "cruddlevee") stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, List, Validate.
  And "Pick at random" is excluded. In outr case, picking a text string at random is purely
  a consequence of what we want our application to do. Hence (without going into
  a perhaps esotreric architectural discussion) it's in the "business" area of concern.
