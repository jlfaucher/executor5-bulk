     Model-View Framework

     showModel(class-inst)  ->  ObjectMgr
     				self~getcreate model


     View components:		subclass RcView
     - newInstance [class method]:
         use arg modelInsanceName, rootDlg
         dlg = .ModelView~new(rc-file, "IDD_...")
         dlg~activate(modelInstancName,rootDlg)
         return dlg

     - activate
         expose modelData
         use arg modelInstanceName, rootDlg
         forward class (super) continue		 Required for MVF
         modelData = RESULT			- personData returned by super
    						- ('forward' returns any result via 'RESULT'.)
         self~popUpAsChild(rootDlg,"SHOWTOP,,icon-resource-id>)

     - initDialog
         expose modelData


     Model components:
     - newInstance (class method):
         use strict arg instanceName
         check id data component is up and running
         get component id of data component from objectMgr
         send "find(instanceName)" to data component - returns "dirData"
         modelId = self~new(dirData)
         return modelId

     - init (instance Method)
         - since no separate setup, 'activate' is same as 'init' so just use 'init'.

     Data components:				- subclassed from GenericFile
     - newInstance (class method):
         use strict arg instanceName		- instanceName is "The".
         dataId = self~new(instanceName)
         return dataId

     - init
         use arg instanceName
         filename = "file-name"; columns = num-columns
         records = self~init:super(fileName, columns)



     Some component X wants to send 'query' to PersonModel. So:
     (a) X sends getComponentId('PersonModel PA150') to ObjectMgr.
     (b) ObjMgr: if exists, then return cmptId
     (c) Else
     Sends 'query' to a PersonModel on Message Sender.
     Messagesender asks ObjectMgr for id of the PersonModel
     If not in object bag, ObjMgr sends 'newInstance' to Model with inst name
     as param.
     .Model~newInstance asks ObjMgr for id for "PersonData The"
     If not found, then set noDataError to .true.
     Else do
       send a "find" to "PersonData The"
       "PersonData The" returns the Model's instance's data.
       If data found, then id = .PersonModel~new(data)
       Return Id (to ObjectMgr)
     end
