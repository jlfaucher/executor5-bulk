Topics (some may not appear in this chapter - if not, they'll go into the next and final chapter 9):
  1. Sorting out the hang when close OrderMgr before closing OrderForm (in Ex 7)
  2. Need for Event Management - tell OrderForm when app is closing (also addition of method ok).
  3. Added function in OrderForm.
  4. "Saving" the OrderForm when complete
  5. moving the View supers into a single mixin.
  6. Drag/Drop
  7. Use of ooSQL (but might be postponed to Chap 9).
  8. ???

      You may have noticed in Exercise 7 that the process hangs when you close the Order Management
      dialog without first closing all Order Form dialogs. This problem, and its solution, is addressed in 
      <xref linkend="chap08-eventMgmt"/>

   <title>Event Management</title>
   <para>If an Order Form is open when the Order Management application is closed, then the process
      hangs. The reason for this is that the OrderForm's control dialogs must be cleaned up
      explicitly when the Order Form dialog is closed - else the control dialogs are left in limbo,
      and the process cannot close. The solution is to tell all Order Form dialogs to close when the
      user closes the application (that is, when the Order Management dialog is closed). The only
      question is how should this be done? Somehow, all active Order Form dialogs must be told about
      the "application close" event so they can clean up the two control dialogs.</para>
    <para>One solution is for the Order Management dialog to tell each Order Form that the
      application is about to close. Perhaps the Order Management dilaog could inquire of the Object
      Manager as to which Order Form dialogs exist, and then send each of them a "close now"
      message. However, a more elegant solution - and one that has much wider potential use - is to
      provide an event management framework. </para>
    <para>A simple event management framework (EMF) is introduce in Exercise 8, and is in the 
      file <computeroutput>EventMgr.rex</computeroutput> in the <computeroutput>Support</computeroutput> folder.
      </para>
     <para>The EMF works like this. First, a component decides that it's interested in some event -
      say "AppClosing". When this event occurs, it wants to be sent a message so that it can take
      appropriate action. To express its interest, the component sends a
        <computeroutput>registerInterest</computeroutput> message to the Event Manager with two
      parameters - the its object id, and the event in which it's interested: <programlisting><![CDATA[   eventMgr = .local~my.eventMgr
    eventMgr~registerInterest(self,"appClosing")]]>      </programlisting> Some time later, when the
      Order Manager is being closed, it asks the Event Manager to trigger the event "appClosing":
      <programlisting><![CDATA[   eventMgr~triggerEvent("appClosing")]]>      </programlisting>This
      results in a <computeroutput>notify</computeroutput> message, with the event name as an
      argument, to be sent to each component that has registered interest in the "appClosing" event: <programlisting><![CDATA[   EventMgr:              <interestedComponent>~notify("appClosing")

    Interested Component:  ::method notify public
                             use arg event
                             if event = "appClosing" then do
                             -- takes appropriate action]]>    </programlisting>Note that this
      simple event management framework is fairly generic, and can be used for any event by any
      component. The only constraint is that event names must be unique. </para>
