I finally fixed this issue by manually changing a line in
publican\xsl\pdf.xsl

from
<xsl:include href=3D"
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/fo/footnote.xsl"/>

to
<xsl:include
href=3D"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Publican/docbook-xsl-1.76.1/fo/f=
ootnote.xsl"/>

not nice, but works for me
