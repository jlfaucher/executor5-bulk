<section><title>New in this Release</title>
<para>
  This section lists the new features and enhancements introduced since Open Object Rexx 4.1.2. However, Open Object
  Rexx 4.1.3 is a bug fix only release and there are no new features or enhancements. This section of the document is
  left as a template for future releases.
</para>
<para>
  You should refer to the CHANGES document accompanying the release for a complete list of the bug fixes.  In addition,
  there is a ReleaseNotes document that contains essentially the same information as this section, but in a text format.
  These documents are accessible from the SourceForge download page for each ooRexx release. They are also included in the
  source code for ooRexx when SourceForge is not used.
</para>

</para>
<para>
  That version is ooDialog 4.2.2.
</para>

  ooDialog release versions have been decoupled from the ooRexx distribution. Independent installation packages for ooDialog 
  are available from SourceForge at: <ulink 
  url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx/files/ooDialog/"><citetitle>ooDialog</citetitle></ulink>
</para>
<para>
  All current ooDialog installation packages, ooDialog 4.0.0 through ooDialog 4.2.2, will install over ooRexx 4.1.3.
</para>
<para>
  If the ooRexx user is unhappy with ooDialog 4.2.2 for any reason, that user can replace ooDialog 4.2.2 with one of the other
