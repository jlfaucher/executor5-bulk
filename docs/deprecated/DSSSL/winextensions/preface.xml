<preface id="preface"><title>About This Book</title>
<para>
  This book describes extensions to the Open Object Rexx Interpreter that are specific to the Windows
  operating system. The extensions are in three main categories.
</para>
<para>
  The first category is a number of classes implemented in a library package,
  <computeroutput>winSystm.cls</computeroutput>. These classes are used to interact with Windows system
  objects like the event log and the clipboard. The second category is <link
  linkend="chapOLEAutomation">OLE Automation </link>. The last category is the <link
  linkend="chapWSH">Windows Scripting Host</link> engine.
</para>
<para>
  These extensions are currently only available on Windows. The Windows Scripting Host and OLE Automation
  can only be implemented on Windows.  Some of the classes, such as the <link
  linkend="clsWindowsEventLog">WindowsEventLog</link> and the <link
  linkend="clsWindowsRegistry">WindowsRegistry</link> classes must be, by their nature, Windows specific.
  Some of the other classes, such as the <link linkend="clsMenuObject">MenuObject</link> or <link
  linkend="clsWindowObject">WindowObject</link> classes could certainly be enhanced to be cross-platform.
  However, at this time there are no plans to do so.
</para>
<para>
  This book is intended for people who plan to develop applications using ooRexx and one or more of the
  Windows specific classes. In general no special knowledge of Windows programming is needed to use the
  Windows extensions. Therefore this book is applicable for users ranging in experience from the novice
  ooRexx programmer, to the experienced application developer.
</para>
<para>
  This book is a reference rather than a tutorial. It assumes the reader has some exposure to
  object-oriented programming concepts and Rexx programming.
</para>
<para>
  The use and syntax of all the classes and their methods is covered in this book. A brief overview of
  OLE Automation and the Windows Scripting Host Engige is given. Many of the descriptions of class
  methods also include example code snippets.

the path of the line.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>&gt;&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol

statement syntax is continued on the next line.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol indicates
that a statement is continued from the previous line.</para>
<para>The <computeroutput>---&gt;&lt;</computeroutput> symbol indicates the end

with the  <computeroutput>&gt;---</computeroutput> symbol and end with

<section><title>A Note About Program Examples in this Document</title>
<para>The program examples in this document are rendered in a mono-spaced
font that is not completely compatible for cut-and-paste functionality.
Pasting text into an editor could result in some characters outside of
the standard ASCII character set. Specifically, single-quote and
double-quote characters are sometimes converted incorrectly when
pasted into an editor.</para>
