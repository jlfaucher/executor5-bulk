 2.) Correct Documentation
 	 on p. 10 there's an error: '%' is not modulo (like in C or Java) but

 3.) If you open an existing Rexx program (from File->Open) and try to set up a Run configuration for 
 	 it, without setting up a Project and including the file in it, you get an NPE 
 	 because RexxLaunchConfigurationTab::getSelectedFile returns null.
 	 
 4.) Implement error highlighting as in: http://jeff.over.bz/papers/2005/instant-ides.pdf
 
 5.) On opening, the file has to be edited to coax the outline content to appear.
