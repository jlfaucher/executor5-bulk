

The WindowRexx DLL comes in both a 64-bit and 32-bit version.  Download the
version that matches your installation of ooRexx.  I.e., if you have the
64-bit version of ooRexx installed, download the 64-bit verion of the
WindowRexx DLL.

After downloading, rename the DLL to windowrexx.dll.  Put both
windowrexx.dll and windoRexx.frm in a directory in you path.  That is all
the set up you need.
