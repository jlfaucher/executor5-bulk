The test programs in this release may or may not work in your environment. Some
of the tests require that your PATH be modified so that the required ooRexx
class files can be found by the tests. In any case, the tests are designed to
show how the accompanying class files are intended to be used, not necessarily
as a full unit or functional test for the supplied classes.

Feel free to modify the accompanying code in any way you please and for any
purpose that you require.
