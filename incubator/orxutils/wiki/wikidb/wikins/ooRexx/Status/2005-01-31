=Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />January - 2005=

==Web Site==

The new [http://www.oorexx.org/ ooRexx Web Site] has been built, and the ooRexx domains;
oorexx.org, oorexx.net, oorexx.com and oorexx.info now point there.

==Interpreter Status==

We now have the interpreter building on Windows and Linux. The Windows port
also builds as a self-extracting executable, using NSIS rather than the IBM installer
which used InstallShield.
A number of problems
are still outstanding with the Solaris port. We are still
looking for help with the AIX platform as none of the current
team has access to an AIX machine.

Further work has gone into reorganizing the directory structure for the source
to make things more consistent and easier to find. Changes to the source are also continuing to
isolate the platform specific code.

Formal testing of ooRexx has commenced. We have received a copy (not for distribution)
of the IBM test suites. We have been fortunate to have Walter Pachl come on board to assist
with testing. Walter was the original test lead for the IBM Rexx Compiler.

==Documentation==

The documentation has been completely converted to DocBook. This should
make revising the documents easier and more portable in the future. There are
still a few formating problems with the documents but they are mostly in very
good shape.

The documentation source should appear on SourceForge sometime during the
month of Feburary. It will be in a seperate CVS module from the interpreter.

==Project Administration==

The proposed [[/:charter|Project Charter]] has been
accepted by the Development Team and has been
submitted to the Rexx Language
Association for approval. We hope to have it approved early in Feburary.

Initial roles for the current project team have been defined. Who is doing what
can be seen on the [[/:contact|ooRexx Contacts]] page.

==Other==

Work is continuing on the RxFtp class library replacement.

As always you can subscribe to the
[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-announce oorexx-announce]
mailing list to receive development updates and news like this.
