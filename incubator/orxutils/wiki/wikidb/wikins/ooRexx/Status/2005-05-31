=Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />May - 2005=

==Web Site==

The new [[/:default|ooRexx Web Site]] has been built,
and the ooRexx domains:
oorexx.org, oorexx.net, oorexx.com and oorexx.info now point there.

==Interpreter Status==

A small bug in the installation program for the Windows version
of ooRexx Version 3.0.0 was reported. A new Version 3.0.1 is available which
fixes the bug. The new version is available
[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119701 here].

There have been over 12,000 downloads of the Version 3.0.x release since it
was made available in March. This puts the ooRexx Project in the top 1% of all
projects on the SourceForge site. Needless to say, the development team is
very pleased with this and we expect that even better things will happen in the
future.

Rick has started to perform the 64-bit cleanup of the code. This will involve
some major updates to the Rexx API and some other features. We do not have a
timeframe for completion of this work.

==Documentation==

A new Version 3.0.0 Revision 1 of the documentation is available. This is a
small update that adds PDF Summary Information to each PDF and fixes a few
formating problems.

We are working on adding indexes to each PDF. This will take some time and
we do not expect a release of the documentation that includes indexes to be
available until sometime in July.

==Project Administration==

The proposed [[/:charter|Project Charter]] has been
adopted by the Rexx Language Association.

Initial roles for the current project team have been defined. Who is doing what
can be seen on the [[/:contact|ooRexx Contacts]] page.

==Other==

As always you can subscribe to the
[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-announce oorexx-announce]
mailing list to receive development updates and news like this.
