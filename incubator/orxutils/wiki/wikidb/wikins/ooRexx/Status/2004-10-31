=Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />October - 2004=

This is the project's first status report so a little introduction seems in
order. Here is the current project team membership.

David Ashley
<br />Rony Flatscher
<br />Mark Hessling
<br />Rick Mc Guire
<br />Pam Taylor

Currently our duties overlap but we will be attempting to refine the leadership
roles over the next month. We are all current members of the Rexx Language
Association and all have an extensive background with the Rexx language. Rick
is one of the original authors of Object Rexx and knows the most about the code
base. David and Mark both have open source backgrounds and Mark is the current
maintainer of Regina Rexx. Rony has extensive experience with Object Rexx and
Pam is attempting to coordinate all of our efforts (its a rough job trying to
keep a bunch of maverick's from going wild).

Once we have finished the initial setup work we will be able to welcome all of
you who are so eager to to contribute to this project.
Many things still need to be done
including adopting a project charter, assign roles, and organizing the project.

IBM and RexxLA have agreed on a joint announcement concerning the Open
Sourcing of Object Rexx, which will be published on the RexxLA
site, once the publishing date within IBM is fixed. This way the
announcement will be jointly published, so
please stay tuned and check back with
[http://www.rexxla.org/ RexxLA].

Now the good news. We have received a LOT of material from IBM and we
expect to receive even more. Here is the list of things we have received, expect
to receive, and some things we will not ever get.

===Items received from IBM===

* Complete source code for the Object Rexx interpreter for Windows, Linux, AIX
and Solaris. There is some code included in this for OS/2 but there is no
build procedure and we are uncertain whether the code is complete enough to
actually build an OS/2 interpreter.
* Source code for the external function libraries rexxutil, rxsock, oodialog,
rxmath and some smaller libraries.
* Documentation in PDF and HTML format.

===Items not yet received from IBM===

* The Windows development environment. We will probably never get this due to
some legal issues with the development libraries used to create this
application.
* Documentation source code. Although the source for the documentation is in
an SGML format it will need to be translated to a different SGML/XML format.
We will require some help with this so if you have any XML/SGML/DocBook
experience please drop us a note.
* Rxftp external function library. There is a legal problem with this library
because IBM used code that is under a non-disclosure agreement. We are
considering replacing this library with an OORexx class that uses the RxSocks
external function library.

There are still a lot of legal issues to overcome before the code can be
put in the SourceForge CVS repository. All theses issues will take some time to
resolve so your patience will be appreciated. Again, please check back with
[http://www.rexxla.org/ RexxLA.org]
or subscribe to the list

to receive development updates and news like this.
