=Procedures for Contributions=

==Contributions to the ooRexx Project==

The contribution from a ''Developer'' is to be provided to the ooRexx project as a context diff (patch file) against
the current revision of a configuration item in the SourceForge CVS repository. Included with the
patch file is a text file stating the source of the contribution ("contribution source statement"),
and a link to the appropriate compatible license.
The contribution is to be uploaded as a new ooRexx SourceForge "patches" tracker item.
An ooRexx ''Committer'' will review the
contribution and the source statement and will decide whether the contribution will be accepted or
rejected. If the contribution is rejected, the ''Committer'' will consult with at least one other ''Committer''
for confirmation, and will advise the contributor of the rejection.
If the contribution is accepted the ''Committer'' will apply the patch against their working version, do
sufficient testing, and commit the changes to the repository. The commit comments MUST include
the text of the '' Developer's '' "contribution source statement".

When a ''Committer'' commits a change to the repository, they MUST include a statement indicating the
source of the contribution.
