=Open Object Rexx Test Wiki=

Welcome to the '''Open Object Rexx''' Wiki. This version is only a test of how a wiki might
work under '''ooRexx'''.

* [[/ooRexx/Main_Page|About Open Object Rexx]]

==This is a Test Web Site==

'''''Warning:'''''
''There is no security enabled on this website. Anyone can edit any wiki page.''
'''''So be careful!'''''

With this version of the Wiki it is possible to edit the wiki pages.
'''Please do not make changes that make the wiki unusable!''' You can,
however, feel free to try out minor additions and changes to the pages.
Just put everything back the way you found it so the next person can
experiment.

It is still not possible to create new pages via the web interface. That
is my next task.

Have fun!<br />
