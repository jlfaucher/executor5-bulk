The files in this directory are used to create some ooSQLPackage shared
libraries.  The only use of these is for the packageAutoRegistration.rex
example program.

The .cpp source code files are simply copies of the examplePackage.cpp
source with some renaming of the collations, aggregates, and functions.
They are not really that useful as example code.  The examplePackage
related files are what is intended to be used as example code.
