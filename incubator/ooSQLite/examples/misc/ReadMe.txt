                             ------------------

The binary database file, foodsPristine.rdbx, was created from a database
definition file, foods.sql, included in the example code that accompanies
the book:

"Definitive Guide to SQLite", Second Edition, by Grant Allen and Mike Owens,
published by Apress.

Apress and the authors have okayed the use and inlcusion of the binary file
in the ooRexx project.

foodsPristine.rdbx is then copied into the samples and samples/informal
directories, as ooFoods.rdbx.  ooFoods.rdbx is used in a number of the
example programs.
