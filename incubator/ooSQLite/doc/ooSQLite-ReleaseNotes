                  ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.11910 (Preview)
                  ========================================

ooSQLite is an ooRexx extension that provides an interface to the SQLite
database engine.  For complete details on SQLite, go to:

http://www.sqlite.org

The SQLite database engine is embedded in the ooSQLite extension.
Therefore, the ooSQLite extension provides everything needed to create,
modify, and query SQL based databases in an ooRexx program.

ooSQLite will work on any system that has an installed ooRexx
interpreter, version 4.1.0 or later.  ooSQLite is completely platform
agnostic.  That is, all ooSQLite code and the database files themselves
will work unchanged on any platform ooRexx is supported on.  A complete
database is stored in a single cross-platform disk file.

ooSQLite provides both an object-orientated interface and a 'classic
Rexx' interface to SQLite.  That is, the object-orientated interface
encapsulates the SQLite provided APIs using different classes and
methods of those classes.  The 'classic Rexx' interface provides a
procedural interface where all SQLite APIs are accessed using function
calls.


IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

NOTE: The "Preview" version is provided so that ooRexx developers and
users have something concrete to refer to in discussions of how ooSQLite
should be implemented.  Some class and method names are likely to
change.  Classes and / or methods may be removed, and / or added.
Arguments to methods may be changed.

Note:
-----

Cumulative changes are located towards the bottom of this file.


To use ooSQLite in an ooRexx program:
-------------------------------------

Simply add this requires statement to the program:

::requires 'ooSQLite.cls'

and ensure that the ooSQLite.cls file and the implementation library
file are somewhere in the path on your system.

The implementation library file is oosqlite.dll on Windows and
oosqlite.so on Unix-like systems.


Documentation:
--------------

The primary source of documentation for ooSQLite is, and will always be,
the SQLite project itself:

http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html

The ooSQLite reference manual will document the class and methods
available in the object-orientated interface, and the functions
available in the 'classic Rexx' interface.  The reference manual will
note exactly which SQLite API the method or function accesses.  But the
in-depth details of: how SQLite works, how to use SQLite, what SQL
SQLite supports, how to write SQL statements will be left to the SQLite
documentation.

Because of this, it is easy to get started with ooSQLite, even though
the documentation is currently light, by referring to the SQLite
website.


Distribution:
-------------

ooSQLite is currently distributed as a standard Windows installer for
installing on Windows and as a compressed archive file for Linux.  There
are separate files for 32-bit, 64-bit, Windows, or Linux.  The future
intent is to add ooSQLite to the ooRexx distribution.

Pick the distribution file to match the bitness, 32-bit or 64-bit, of
the ooRexx interpreter installed on the system.  Pick one of the *.exe
files for Windows and one of the *_lin.tgz files for Linux:

ooSQLite_1_0_0_xxxx_x86_32.exe         <- Windows 32-bit binaries
ooSQLite_1_0_0_xxxx_x86_64.exe         <- Windows 64-bit binaries
ooSQLite_1_0_0_xxxx_x86_32_lin.tgz     <- Linux 32-bit binaries
ooSQLite_1_0_0_xxxx_x86_32_lin.tgz     <- Linux 64-bit binaries

The 'xxxx' in the file name will be the svn revision number, which may
vary slightly depending on the exact time the distribution file is
built.

Mac OS X pre-compiled binaries are available, but out of date.
Hopefully AIX pre-compiled binaries will be added shortly.
Unfortunately, this is dependent on a developer willing to build the
binaries stepping forward.


Installation Windows:
---------------------

* Down load and execute the appropriate distribution file.  The Windows
  installer will install ooSQLite to the ooRexx installation directory.
  An uninstaller is included with the ooSQLite installation.


Installation Linux:
---------------------

* Down load the appropriate distribution file to a directory of your
  choice on your system.

* Unpack the file using tar.  tar -xzfv <fileName>

* Unpacking the distribution file will create a subdirectory tree that
  looks like this:

ooSQLite.1.0.0.xxxx
   |
   *---bin
   |
   *---doc
   |
   *---examples
   |     |
   |     *---classic.rexx
   |     |
   |     *---user.extensions
   |           |
   |           *---autoPackages
   |
   *---misc
   |
   *---testing

The bin subdirectory contains the files that need to be included in the
path.  Either add bin to your path or copy the files in bin to a
directory already in the path on your system.  ooSQLite is now ready for
use.

The root of the subdirectory tree (ooSQLite.1.0.0.xxxx) contains a few
text documents, including this ReleaseNotes file, that are typically
found in an open source software distribution.

In addition it contains a .sh file that can be used to temporarily set
up ooSQLite for use on the system.  The files simply adds the bin
directory to the path.

On Linux, if bash is your shell, source the setOOSQLiteEnv.sh file:

ooSQLite.1.0.0.7817# . ./setOOSQLiteEnv.sh

The doc subdirectory contains documentation files for ooSQLite.
Currently the documentation is meager.  The directory also contains an
excel spreadsheet, StatusAllSQLiteFunctions.xlsx, that lists every
SQLite API and notes its implementation status in ooSQLite.

The examples subdirectory contains example programs showing how to use
ooSQLite.  At this time only a few examples are available.

The misc subdirectory contains a binary database file that is used in
some of the example programs and some of the testing programs.  Please
read the ReadMe file in that directory for information.

The testing subdirectory contains some programs used in the original
development of ooSQLite.  These programs are currently meant to
supplement the example programs, since there are only a few examples.

In the future, the testing subdirectory will be removed from the
distribution.  The testing programs will either remain in the source
repository to be used as development aids, or enhanced to example
programs and moved to the examples subdirectory.

The "Preview" version of ooSQLite
=================================

The preview version of ooSQLite is being provided to give anyone
interested in an extension for ooRexx that provides database access to
ooRexx programs, a chance to see what ooSQLite can provide.  And to
contribute to the direction for ooSQLite.

Anyone can check out the entire, current, ooSQLite source tree from its
location in the ooRexx repository using this svn command:

svn co https://oorexx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/oorexx/incubator/ooSQLite  ooSQLite

However, it seems that many ooRexx users are unwilling to do that.  So,
a preview distribution is being put on SourceForge to allow anyone to
easily get their hands on a current version of ooSQLite.

The point of making a preview version of ooSQLite is to solicit input
from users on what ooSQLite should or shouldn't do.  What classes should
or shouldn't be named, should or shouldn't be included.  What methods
and functions should or shouldn't be included.  Etc., etc..

In other words, to discuss the implementation of ooSQLite at its start.

In addition, it would be highly appreciated if users would contribute to
the testing of ooSQLite by writing test programs.  If users would
contribute to the ooSQLite package by writing and submitting example
programs to the ooRexx project.

Please join in and participate in discussions concerning ooSQLite on the
ooRexx users list, which can be subscribed to at:

https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=119701

Discussion of ooSQLite is encouraged at any of the lists used by ooRexx
users, RexxLa, the developers list, etc., but the user list is the one
place that all users of ooRexx can access.  This makes it the ideal
place to carry out discussions of things related to ooRexx, that include
the entire user community.


                          Cumulative Changes:
                          ===================

Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.9974 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The SQLite library is updated to version 3.29.0.  No new features
introduced after 3.8.0 have been implemented in ooSQLite.

ooSQLite was updated as follows:
* return BLOBs as ooRexx String (instead of Buffer) objects
* method columnText() and its equivalent routine now return all data
  bytes of a BLOB instead of truncating it at the first NUL character
* fixed a bug in method columnValue() and its equivalent routine which
  always caused error SQLITE_MISUSE


Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.9908 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The SQLite library is updated to 3.8.4.3.  The changes to the SQLite

have had no new features added.  So, there was nothing that needed to be
updated in ooSQLite.


Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.9391 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The SQLite library is updated to 3.8.3.  All new features in 3.8.1 have
been implemented, with the exception of the SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC bit.
This is a feature of SQLite that few, if any, ooRexx programers would
use.  A RFE has been opened for and support for it will be added to
ooSQLite in the relatively near future.  ooSQLite users that are
interested in tracking this can suscribe to the:

#584 Add support to ooSQLite for the SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC bit

feature request ticket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SQLite library is updated to 3.7.16.1

  Implementation changes:
  -----------------------

  The ooSQLiteConstants class constant: NULL has been renamed to SQLNULL
  so that it does not clash with the attribute of the same name in the
  ooSQLite, ooSQLiteConnection, and ooSQLiteStmt classes.


  Bugs:
  ----

  The following bugs reported on SourceForge have been fixed:

  * #1158 ooSQLite ooSQLiteConnection tableColumnMetaData Catch22 error



  Enhancements:

  this pragma has been add to:

    ooSQLiteConnection class:
    -------------------------

      pragma() method

  * SQLite 3.7.16 adds new extended error codes for all
  SQLITE_CONSTRAINT errors.  Support for these error codes has been
  added to:

    ooSQLiteConstants class:
    ------------------------
      CONSTRAINT_CHECK
      CONSTRAINT_COMMITHOOK
      CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY
      CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION
      CONSTRAINT_NOTNULL

  * SQLite 3.7.16 adds a new extended error code
  SQLITE_READONLY_ROLLBACK.  Support for this error code has been added
  to:

    ooSQLiteConstants class:
    ------------------------
      READONLY_ROLLBACK

  * SQLite 3.7.16 has a large number of other enhancements and
  performance improvements, however taking advantage of these
  improvements does not require any other code changes to ooSQLite.
  They are available automatically by updating ooSQLite to use the
  SQLite 3.7.16 library.


  Feature Requests:
  -----------------

  * #533 ooSQLite NULL output presentation

  The Rexx programmer can specify how the SQL NULL value should be
  returned to the application.  By default the .nil object is returned
  for any NULL value in the database.  This returned value can be
  changed to any string value desired by setting the null attribute
  of the ooSQLite, ooSQLiteConn, or ooSQLiteStmt classes.



  Documentation:
  --------------

  Some small progress has been made on the docs.





Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.8514 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SQLite library is updated to 3.7.15

  Bugs:
  ----

  The following bugs reported on SourceForge have been fixed:

  * #1133 Abnormal termination in oosqlexec()

  * #1142 ooSQLite callback functions can use larger than needed memory
          resources

  * #1144 OOsqlite3 Foreign_keys


  Enhancements:
  -------------

  * SQLite 3.7.15 introduces a new SQLite API: sqlite3_errStr.  Support
  for this API is added to:

    ooSQLite class:
    --------------

      errStr() method

    Classic interface:
    ------------------

    oosqlErrStr() routine

  * SQLite 3.7.15 adds a new PRAGMA: busy_timeout.  Support for this
  pragma has been add to:

    ooSQLiteConnection class:
    -------------------------

      pragma() method


  * Enforcement of foreign key constraints is enabled by default for new
  database connections, in both ooSQLite and ooSQLite3.  Each database
  connection can always turn enforcement of foreign key constraints off
  at run-time using the foreign_keys pragma.  This "enhancement" is a
  result of bug #1144 listed above.

  In SQLite, enforcement of foreign key constraints is normally off by
  default.  This is changed in ooSQLite so that enforcement of foreign
  key constraints will be on by default.


  Documentation:
  --------------

  Some small progress has been made on the docs.





Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.8472 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SQLite library is updated to 3.7.14.1.

  Enhancements:
  -------------

  Some optimizations have been added to the creation of the result sets
  during the running of the exec() method of the ooSQLiteConnection
  class.  This results in a performance gain of about 10% and a memory
  usage reduction of about 30%.

  Support for the SQLite Full Text Search (FTS3 andFTS4) is compiled
  into ooSQLite.  FTS3 and FTS4 are SQLite virtual table modules that
  allows users to perform full-text searches on a set of documents.  See
  the SQLite website at: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_1_1 for
  complete details.

  The OO_CLASSIC_STEM format was added as a format option for result

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  *

  Documentation:
  --------------

  * The first chapter in the reference manual, About This Book, is
  finished.

  * The second chapter in the reference manual, Brief Overview, is
  finished.

  * The documentation in the reference manual for the .ooSQLite class is
  finished.



  Examples (examples directory):
  -----------------------------

  * createDatabase.rex is enhanced to use foreign keys when creating the
  tables.

  * insertIntoDatebase.rex now inserts records into all of the tables
  in the database.

  * A new example, insertNull.rex is added.

  * A new example, insertNullTwo.rex is added.

  * A new example, insertNullThree.rex is added.

  * A new example, printTableWithNulls.rex is added.

  * A new example, enquote.rex is added.


  Examples (testing directory):
  -----------------------------

  The examples in the testing directory have been used by the developers
  during implementation.  A few of these programs are made available to
  help people get started with ooSQLite.  In general these are not well
  documented and will eventually be removed from the distribution as
  more examples are added to the examples directory.

  The following programs have been added to the testing subdirectory:

  * (none)

  The following changes were made to the testing subdirectory:

  * (none)



  Bugs:
  ----

  *


  * No bugs were reported on SourceForge in this cycle.


  Changes in implementation:
  --------------------------

  * The argument to ooSQLite::memoryHighWater was intended to be
  optional, but it was not.  The argument has been changed to be
  optional.

  * The argument to the oosqlMemoryHighWater() function was intended to
  be optional, but it was not.  The argument has been changed to be
  optional.

  * Both ooSQLite::threadSafe() and oosqlThreadSafe() were returning
  true or false, but they actually should return one of 0, 1, or 2.
  Forcing the return to a logical prevented 2 from being returned.  This
  was changed to return a number.


  Enhancements:
  -------------

  * Foreign key support is enabled for each database connection
  automatically.

  * The command line shell, oosqlite3 has several startup defauts
  changed.  The .mode on startup is now column rather than list. .header
  is now ON by default instead of OFF.

  * The enquote() method is added to the .ooSQLite class.

  * The ooSQLiteEnquote() function is added to the classic Rexx
  interface.




Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.7864 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The embedded SQLite database engine is now version 3.7.13

  Documentation:
  --------------

  * The changes, including the interfaces to the SQLite online backup
  feature, are fully documented in the ooSQLite Reference Manual.


  Examples (examples directory):
  -----------------------------

  * The classic.rexx subdirectory was added to contain examples of using
  the 'classic Rexx' interface to SQLite.

  * The preparedStmtTestRtn.rex program in the testing directory was
  renamed to preparedStmtRtn.rex and moved from the testing subdirectory
  to the examples\classic.rexx subdirectory.  The program was enhanced
  with many comments.

  * The pullColumnDataRtn.rex example was added to the
  examples\classic.rexx subdirectory.

  * The backupDB.rex example was added to the examples\classic.rexx
  subdirectory.


  Examples (testing directory):
  -----------------------------

  The examples in the testing directory have been used by the developers
  during implementation.  A few of these programs are made available to
  help people get started with ooSQLite.  In general these are not well
  documented and will eventually be removed from the distribution as
  more examples are added to the examples directory.

  The following programs have been added to the testing subdirectory:

  * (none)

  The following changes were made to the testing subdirectory:

  * The preparedStmtTestRtn.rex program was enhanced, renamed, and moved
  to the examples\classic.rexx subdirectoy with the name of
  preparedStmtRtn.rex.



  Bugs:
  ----

  * Two trivial bugs bugs were found internally and fixed.

  * Fixed crash when result set format was an array of directories or an
  a stem of stems when using ooSQLiteConnection::pragma(). This crash
  was exhibited in the pragmaTriggerTest.rex

  * No bugs were reported on SourceForge in this cycle.


  Changes in implementation:
  --------------------------

  * The 'classic Rexx' interface is intended for use by Rexx programmers
  that are uncomfortable with 'objects.'  However, in a very few cases
  an object such as a .Directory object was used as an IN/OUT parameter
  for functions that needed to return multiple values.

  This has been fixed in all cases to use a purely 'classic Rexx'
  paradigm.  Since these functions were not documented yet, and there
  were no examples of their usage, this change should be invisible.

  * The oosqlPrepare() method has been changed to return a result code
  rather than a handle to the prepared statement.  The arguments to the
  function are also changed.  This makes the function totally 'classic
  Rexx.'  The usage of this function was visible in the program:

  testing\preparedStmtTestRtn.rex

  To understand the new usage examine the programs:

  examples\classic.rexx\preparedStmtRtn.rex
  examples\classic.rexx\pullColumnDataRtn.rex

  both of which are heavily commented.

  * The oosqlOpen() method has been changed to return a result code
  rather than a handle to the database connection.  The arguments to the
  function are also changed.  This makes the function totally 'classic
  Rexx.' The usage of this function was visible in the program:

  testing\preparedStmtTestRtn.rex

  To understand the new usage examine the programs:

  examples\classic.rexx\preparedStmtRtn.rex
  examples\classic.rexx\pullColumnDataRtn.rex

  both of which are heavily commented.

  * The first argument to ooSQLitleMutex::new(), the mutex type
  argument, was required.  This has changed to be optional, with
  MUTEX_FAST being the default.

  * The ooSQLiteStmt::errMsg attribute has been renamed to lastErrMsg.


  Enhancements:
  -------------

  * The .ooSQLiteBackup class has been added.

  * The ooSQLiteConnection::backupDestination attribute has been added.

  * The ooSQLiteStmt::lastErrCode attribute has been added.

  * The oosqlBackupInit(), oosqlBackupFinish(), oosqlBackupPageCount(),
  oosqlRemaining(), and oosqlBackupStep() functions have been added.
  This gives the Rexx programmer using the 'classic Rexx' interface
  complete access to the SQLite online backup API.

  * The oosqlIsHandleNull() function has been added.

  * The oosqlColumnIndex() function has been added.



Changes since ooSQLite Version 1.0.0.7833 (Preview)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Documentation:
  --------------

  A rough draft of the ooSQLite Reference manual is now available in the
  doc directory.  The reference lists all classes, methods, constants,
  and public routines in ooSQLite.  The entries are almost all
  "template" entries, not yet filled in.


  Examples (examples directory):
  -----------------------------

  * The pullColumnData.rex example is added.


  Examples (testing directory):
  -----------------------------

  The examples in the testing directory have been used by the developers
  during implementation.  A few of these programs are made available to
  help people get started with ooSQLite.  In general these are not well
  documented and will eventually be removed from the distribution as
  more examples are added to the examples directory.

  The following programs have been added to the testing directory:

  * execTestA.rex

  * execTestD.rex

  * execTestNoExec.rex

  * execTestS.rex

  * pragmaGetTest.rex

  * pragmaSetTest.rex

  * pragmaSpecialTest.rex

  * pragmaTriggerTest.rex

  * statusTest.rex

  * versionTest.rex


  Bugs:
  ----

  No bugs found in this cycle.


  Changes in implementation:
  --------------------------

  * The ooSQLiteDB class is renamed to the ooSQLiteConnection class.

  * The ooSQL class is renamed to the ooSQLiteConstants class.


  Enhancements:
  -------------

  * The ooSQLiteConstants class is made a mixin class and is inherited
  by the ooSQLite, ooSQLiteConnection, ooSQLiteStmt, and ooSQLiteMutex
  classes.

  * Functionality is added that allows the programmer to specify the
  format of the result set returned from a SELECT query.  These 3
  formats are currently available: an Array of Directories, an Array of
  Arrays, or a Stem of Stems.

  The default is an Array of Directories.  The programmer can change the
  default format on a process-wide, database-wide, or prepared-statement
  wide basis.

  The default format can be over-ridden using an argument to the
  ooSQLiteConnection::exec() method and by an argument to the
  oosqlExec() public routine.

  * The ooSQLiteStmt::columnIndex() has been added
