    add ClientEvent calls to channel and nick classes
	060609 partly done, mode parse for channel missing
	061009 Done. still a bug with channel mode parsing
    implement talkback objects for client, channel and users (Isn't the client~Command enough?)
	061009 IRCCommands class is sufficient
    make functions accessible again (in progress, working again, now all functions need to be implemented)
	061009 Done...
    use server-specific functions
	like dccallow on irchighway
    parse server parameters (done 060924)

060602
    add support for dcc
	direct chat, file transfer, sed encryption
	
060609
    Get someone to develop a client
    clean the socket class
	060609 INPUT bug (finally!) fixed
	maybe the socket interface in one of the OS/2 examples should be used?
	060924 readserv fixed by rewriting it
    Clean the SVN repos
	talk to ktk to move it to netlabs as primary server !? done
    Add delayed writing (like the perl irc interface does it)

061001
    Idea to avoid client crashing because of malicious methods:
	start method
	    (method runs)
	wait timeout...
	check if the method is still running
	wait some more time
	return (?kill method?)

061009
    Add an Error method to the IRC class to be called by the socket class in
    case of an error
    
General ToDo's:
    Write a test application
    Generate a list of test cases
    Ask someone on usability
