  This is the read me file explaining how the ooRexxUnit frame is used by
the ooRexx team to test ooRexx.

NOTE: This is mostly a place-holder file, it is just barely started.  But,
the quick start notes below should allow one to quickly run the current
test suite.

NOTE: You need to match the ooRexxUnit version level with the version of
the ooRexx interpreter you are running.

Quick Start:
============

The ooRexxUnit directory needs to be in the path, or one needs to run the
test suite from that directory.

Here is the simplest way to run the test suite against the interpreter
package.

* Start in the directory this file is located in, in a console or command
prompt session.

* Run one of the setTestEnv files.  setTestEnv.sh on Linux under the bash
shell.  setTestEnv.bat on Windows.  This will add the framework directory
to the path in your console or command prompt session.

* Use the runtTestGroups.rex program to run the test suite.

1.) runTestGroups.rex -h will show the syntax.

2.) Of course the exact invocation is different on Linux and Windows.

* Linux example:

Raven:/ooRexxUnit # . ./setTestEnv.sh
Raven:/ooRexxUnit # ./runTestGroups.rex -r -2 ooRexx/

* Windows example (this assumes a standard Windows install where .rex has
been associated with the interpreter.)

C:\ooRexxUnit> setTestEnv.bat
C:\ooRexxUnit> runTestGroups -r -2 ooRexx
