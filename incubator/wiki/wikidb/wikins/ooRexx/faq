=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)=

===Q: When can I get it?===

Now! The first public release of '''ooRexx''' is now available. See the
[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119701 Downloads Page]
for the location of files to download.

===Q: What is the difference between <b>ooRexx</b> and IBM's Object REXX for Windows?===

IBM's '''Object REXX''' was available in two formats; an ''Interpreter Edition''
and a ''Development Edition''. '''ooRexx''' will be available in one format which is
half way between the two IBM offerings.
<br />
There will be no functional difference between the '''Object REXX''' and '''ooRexx''' interpreters;
code written for '''Object REXX''' will work with '''ooRexx''' with the following minor exceptions
related to product versioning:

* The result from '''PARSE VERSION''' using the last version of '''Object REXX''' is:
<pre>OBJREXX 6.00 dd mon yyyy</pre>
The result from '''PARSE VERSION''' using the first version of '''ooRexx''' is:
<pre>REXX-ooRexx(MT) 6.00 dd mon yyyy</pre>
This change was done for two reasons; the first is that '''ooRexx''' is a different product,
and the format of the result in now ANSI compliant.

* The output from ''rexx -v'' using the last version of '''Object REXX''' is:
<pre>
IBM Object REXX Interpreter Version 2.1.3
Build date: Mar 31 2004
Copyright (c) IBM Corporation 1996, 2004. All Rights Reserved.
</pre>
The output from ''rexx -v'' using the first version of '''ooRexx''' is:
<pre>
Open Object Rexx Interpreter Version 3.0.0
Build date: Mar 25 2005

Due to licensing issues related to components of '''Object REXX''', not all portions of the
''developer edition'' were made available to RexxLA. Therefore the following components
are not available in '''ooRexx''':

* '''IBM Resource Workshop''' - This component allowed the user to create Windows-based dialogs for use
by the OODialog component. Existing OODialog programs will still work with '''ooRexx''', as
the source to the runtime component of OODialog has been made available.
* '''Object REXX Workbench''' - This component is the '''Object REXX''' IDE which allowed the user to write and debug
'''Object REXX''' programs in an IDE.
* '''rxftp function package''' - This component provided external functions to allow FTP
sessions to be programatically controlled.

===Q: What is the difference between ooRexx and IBM's Object REXX for Linux/Solaris/AIX?===

Due to licensing issues mentioned above, the rxftp function package is not available.
The differences with the versioning details as described in the Windows differences above
is also applicable to these ports.

===Q: Why is there no AIX port of ooRexx?===

The AIX port has proven to be a problem. The development team does not have much experience with AIX
and access to a suitable AIX development machine has proven difficult. If you have both the above,
please let the [[contact|ooRexx Development Team]] know!

===Q: Why is there no OS/2 (eCS) port of ooRexx?===

The source code provided to RexxLA was maintained by one group of IBM developers. The source
code for OS/2 is maintained by a different group of IBM developers, and that source code
base was not supplied to RexxLA. One of the future tasks for this project is to port
the Open Source code for '''ooRexx''' to OS/2.

===Q: When will a port of ooRexx to "XYZ" be available?===

Any POSIX-based, Un*x-like platform is likely to already be available in the source distribution
due to the use of the autoconf toolset. If not, then support for the particular platform will
need to be implemented in a future version of '''ooRexx'''.

===Q: How can I help?===

Now the initial release of '''ooRexx''' has been made and the source code made publically accessible
via SourceForge's CVS servers,
[[contact|ooRexx Development Team]],
will be accepting submissions for
changes and expanding the devlopment team with suitably enthusiastic and qualified
developers to assist in the future development of '''ooRexx'''.
