=Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />November - 2004=

We have run into a delay in getting the project established. The IBM lawyers
want to take the source code through another round of internal review before
releasing it to the Open Source community. This means a delay of at least
another month (and probably more like two months) before we can really begin
putting a release together. This is disappointing news but we do not believe
that this process will impact IBM's decision to open source Object Rexx. As
always, lawyers have the last say in any legal process of this nature.

But there is good news. IBM has finally approved the language for the joint
IBM/RexxLA announcement concerning Open Object Rexx. Look for the announcement
on the [http://www.rexxla.org/ RexxLA] web site as well as the
Open Object Rexx home page.

The proposed charter for the project is currently under review and we hope to
adopt it by the end of December.

===Here is the latest status for items received from IBM===

* Complete source code for the Object Rexx interpreter for Windows, Linux, AIX
and Solaris. The code we were given does not contain all the materials necessary
to build an OS/2 interpreter.
* Source code for the external function libraries rexxutil, rxsock, oodialog,
rxmath and some smaller libraries.
* Documentation in PDF and HTML format.

===Here is the latest status for items not yet received from IBM===

* The Windows development environment. We will probably never get this due to
some legal issues with the development libraries used to create this
application.
* Documentation source code. We may be able to obtain the SGML source from
IBM after all, but it will be in a proprietary SGML format. But all is not lost
as we have found a source who will be willing to extract the source in DocBook
format from the supplied PDFs including the style sheet and index
information.
* Rxftp external function library. There is a legal problem with this library
because IBM used code that is under a non-disclosure agreement. Work has begun on
a replacement for RxFtp in the form of an ORexx class library which invokes the
RxSock external function library to communicate with the target FTP server.
This will not be a direct functional replacement for the RxFtp external library
but it will provide equivalent functionality in the form of a class library.

We have also begun transitioning the build process to use the open source
auto tools (autoconf, libtool, etc). We still have a lot of work to do to make
this approach work but we are making progress. This work should make the build
process portable across multiple platforms including the Windows CygWin
environment.

There are still a lot of legal issues to overcome before the code can be
put in the SourceForge CVS repository. All theses issues will take some time to
resolve so your patience will be appreciated. Again, please check back with
