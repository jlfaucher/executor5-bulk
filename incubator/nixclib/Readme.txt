                           Notes for UnixAPI

1. These APIs are eventually going to be placed in a library distributed with ooRexx
   (just the *nix versions).
2. All of these APIs have been tested on Fedora 12. Additional testing on other *nix
   platforms is needed.
3. None of these APIs (that I am aware of) are available for Windows.
