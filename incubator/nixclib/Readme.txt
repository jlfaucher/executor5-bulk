                           Notes for nixclib

1. These APIs are eventually going to be merged into RexxUtil. They are currently being
   compiled into a library of their own for testing purposes.
2. All of these APIs have been tested on Fedora 12. Additional testing on other *nix
   platforms is needed.
3. None of these APIs (that I am aware of) are available for Windows.
