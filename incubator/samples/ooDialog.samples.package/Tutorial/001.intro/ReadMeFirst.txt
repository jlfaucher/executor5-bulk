                           =====================

To follow the tutorial sequentially, be sure to run and read the comments of
the programs in this directory, in the following order:

  logonUser.rex
  logonRc.rex
  logonRes.rex

These progams:

  logonUser_uc.rex
  logonRc_uc.rex
  logonRes_uc.rex

contain un-commented code for the corresponding tutorial program.  The idea
is to to present the code itself without other distraction.
