                          Extra ooDialog Samples
                          ======================

  The extra ooDialog samples package is meant to provide ooDialog
  programmers with example programs beyond what is shipped with the regular
  ooRexx installation.

  ooDialog users should request examples they would like to see, and are
  encouraged to submit their own example programs that they would like to
  share with other users.  It would be gratifying to the author if ooDialog
  users participated in shaping what example programs are included in the
  package.

  The example programs are installed through a normal Windows installer,
  which includes an uninstall program.  The package can be cleanly,
  completely, uninstalled using the Control Panel -> Add / Remove Programs.
  Alternatively, the package can be uninstalled by running the
  uninstaller.exe program in the installation directory.

  By default the package is installed in the current user's application data
  folder.  This location can be changed during installation.


                              Release Notes
                      Extra ooDialog Samples v0.0.1
                      =============================

  Requires:

  Version 0.0.1 of the package requires ooDialog 4.2.0.7033 or later to run
  all example programs in the package.

  This initial release only contains a few programs.  In general the
  programs are heavily commented.  To gain the full benefit of the examples,
  the comments throughout the program code should be read.  Some directories
  may contain additional documentation in the form of "read me" files within
  the directory.

  Enjoy!
