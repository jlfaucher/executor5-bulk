 Kedit Macros
 ============

In this folder are two utilities for use with the Kedit editor when coding
in Rexx or ooRexx.

They were previously available on my (now-defunct) website.

Rexindex provides a popup menu to allow the user to locate subroutines,
procedures, classes, methods or routines by name.

Rexpand is a framework which provides syntax completion for rexx, kex and/or ooRexx.

Instructions for use are in the header of each file.
They are coded in KEX, the rexx variant provided with Kedit for macros.

They should be looked upon as code samples, free for use or adaption.

thanks,
