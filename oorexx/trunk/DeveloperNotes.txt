Updating the Version of ooRexx
------------------------------

There are a number of files that need to be updated when the version of Open
Object Rexx changes. Here is the list:

configure.ac
oorexx.ver
shared/windows/verinfo_exe.rc
shared/windows/verinfo_dll.rc
rexxapi/daemon/RexxService.h



Building ooRexx on Linux/Unix
-----------------------------

ooRexx uses the standard autoconf build mechanism for Linux/Unix. Here are the
steps:

./bootstrap               (only nneded if configure is not present)
./configure
./make
./make install            (only needed if you want to install ooRexx)


Building ooRexx on Windows
--------------------------

ooRexx uses a fairly standard Visual C++ build process under Windows. Here are
the steps.

make                      (run the make.bat batch file)

This invokes NMAKE with the correct arguments.

If you are using Visual C++ 7.x or later be sure to read the contents of the
Nmake.inc file, you may want to take advantage of some of the features you
find documented there. This is also the place to specify a 64-bit Windows
build.
