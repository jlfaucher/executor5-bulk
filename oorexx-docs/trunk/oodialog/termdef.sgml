<chapter id="termdef"><title>Definition of Terms</title>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>id</term>
<listitem><para>The identification number of a dialog item.
You assign an ID when you create the resource definition for your dialog.
IDs 1, 2, and 9 are reserved for the OK, Cancel, and Help push buttons. An
ID can be either numerical (for example, 100) or symbolic (for example,
"Bankaccount_Entry").
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>handle</term>
<listitem><para>A unique reference to a Windows object assigned by the system.
It can be a reference to a dialog, a particular dialog item, or a graphic
object (pen, brush, font). Handles are required for certain methods; they
can be retrieved from the system when needed.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>device context</term>
<listitem><para>Stores information about the graphic objects that are displayed, such
as bitmaps, lines, and pixels, and the tools used to display them, such as
pens, brushes, and fonts. A device context can be acquired for a dialog or
a button; it must be explicitly freed when the text or graphic operations
are completed.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>pixel</term>
<listitem><para>Individual addressable point within a window. VGA screens support 640
by 480 pixels, SVGA screens support higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600,
1024 by 768, 1280 by 1024, and 1600 by 1200. Pixel values in a dialog start
at the top left corner and include the window title and border.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>dialog unit</term>
<listitem><para>Used within dialog box templates to define the size and position of
the dialog box and its controls. There is a horizontal and a vertical dialog
base unit to convert width and height of dialog boxes and controls from dialog
units to pixels and vice versa. The value of these base units depend on the
screen resolution and the active system font; they are stored in attributes
of the UserDialog class.

</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>color</term>
<listitem><para>Each color supported by the Windows operating system is assigned a
number. Sample color indexes are 0 (black), 1 (dark red), 2 (dark green),
3 (dark yellow), 4 (dark blue), 5 (purple), 6 (blue grey), 7 (light grey),
8 (pale green), 9 (light blue), 10 (white), 11 (grey), 12 (dark grey), 13
(red), 14 (light green), 15 (yellow), 16 (blue), 17 (pink), 18 (turquoise).
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>color palette</term>
<listitem><para>An array that contains color values identifying the colors that can
currently be displayed or drawn on the output device.</para>
<para>Color palettes are
used by devices that can generate many colors but can only display or draw
a subset of them at a time. For such devices, Windows maintains a system palette to
track and manage the current colors of the device.</para>
<para>Applications do not
have direct access to this system palette. Instead, Windows associates
a default palette with each device context. Applications can use the colors
in the default palette.</para>
<para>The default palette is an array of color values
identifying the colors that can be used with a device context by default.
Windows associates the default palette with a context whenever an application
creates a context for a device that supports color palettes. The default palette
ensures that colors are available for use by an application without any further
action. The default palette typically has 20 entries (colors), but the exact
number of entries can vary from device to device.  The colors in the default
palette depend on the device. Display devices, for example, often use the
16 standard colors of the VGA display and 4 other colors defined by Windows.
