                      ooRexx RexxGTK3 Readme
                         Version 2.0.0 

This is the first official beta release of the RexxGTK package for ooRexx. It is fully functional
in its current form, but does not yet fully cover all classes and functions available in the GTK+
system.

Requirements:
    ooRexx 4.2
    GTK+ v3.0 or later

The GTK+ system is usually loaded on most Linux releases. For Windows you must download
additional libraries. See the windows-building.txt and windows-gtk.setup.notes files for more
information on how to obtain the GTK+ system libraries and build a copy of the rexxgtk.dll.

A copy of the librexxgtk.so library for Fedora 11 is supplied with this release. You may need
to build your own copy if the library for other Linux distributions.

Please open a bug report on the SourceForge ooRexx site should you find any problems with RexxGTK.

I hope this beta release meets your ecpectations. Please be aware that this is only a beta and
some classes and methods may change over time. Also, additional classes, widgets and methods
will be added later.

I hope you have fun.
