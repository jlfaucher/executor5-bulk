               Unix Installation Notes for Open Object Rexx
               --------------------------------------------

Please read ALL of these notes before building ooRexx!

To install ooRexx, you first need to configure it.  This is done by
executing the configure script provided in this archive.

Generally all you need to run is "configure", but there are some
options that can be passed to the configure script; use
"./configure --help" to view them. If the configure script does not
exist then run "./bootstrap" script to create it.

Once the configure script has been run, you can then type "make".
This will create the following objects:

 rexx            the ooRexx interpreter
 rxapi           the ooRexx daemon/service manager
 rexxc           the ooRexx "compiler"; it is really a tokenizer
 rxqueue         interface from command line to Rexx queue
 rxsubcom        enables subcommand environments to be manipulated
 librexx.so      shared library containing majority of interpreter
 librexxapi.so   shared library containing API functionality
 librxmath.so    maths extension library
 librexxutil.so  RexxUtil extension library; system functions
 librxregexp.so  Regular Expression extension library
 librxsock.so    Low-level socket extension library

Once you have ooRexx compiled, it can then be installed.  By default, the
ooRexx executables will be installed into /opt/ooRexx/bin and the libraries
and external function packages (*.so) will be installed into
/opt/ooRexx/lib/ooRexx.  The base path "/opt/ooRexx" can be changed by adding
the --prefix=path (where path is the base path) to the configure command.
eg. to install ooRexx into /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/ooRexx,
configure --prefix=/usr/local ...

On most platforms, it is necessary to include the directory where shared
libraries (including *.so) reside, to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable.  Under AIX this environment variable is LIBPATH.
Under HP-UX this environment variable is SHLIB_PATH.
Under SGI seems to be LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH.

Platform Specifc Notes
----------------------
DEC/HP Alpha:
ooRexx currently cannot be built on this platform. ooRexx assumes pointers and
longs are 32bit, and as the Alpha has never had a 32bit mode, it is not possible
to force pointers and longs to 32 bits.

AMD Opteron:
ooRexx can be built as either a 32-bit or a 64-bit application in this environment.
Use the -m32 option to force a 32-bit compilation. The configure script will
dynamically choose the -m32 or -m64 flag depending on the compile environment.

*BSD Platforms:
ooRexx cannot be built on these platforms yet. ooRexx uses some members of internal
C structs which are not portable across platforms.

Mac OSX Platforms (Darwin):
--------------------------
This release of ooRexx should build out-of-the box on OSX 10.3 and above.
To build on OSX 10.2, you must have the libdl.dylib shared library and dlfcn.h
installed. If these have not been installed in /usr/lib and /usr/include respectively,
you will need to do the following before running configure:
% export CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include
% export LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib
(Assuming the library and header file have been installed in /sw/lib and /sw/include
respectively).
OSX 10.2 does not support the NLS message catalog functions such as catopen() etc.
This means that you will NOT get meaningful error messages from the interpreter and
utility programs.
ooRexx may or may not build on OSX 10.1 or below. You're on your own here.

Notes for developers
====================
For full details of making changes to the ooRexx source, consult the
Developer's Guide (when it is written). In the interim, some actions will
need to be carried out if any changes are made to the build targets,
particularly when porting to other platforms. If any changes are made
to Makefile.am or configure.ac, then the generation of the configure
script will need to be re-executed. The safest way to do this to ensure
all steps are carried is to execute the
"bootstrap" script.

% bootstrap

You will require recent versions of autoconf, automake and libtool to get
the best out of the "auto" tools. At least the following versions should
be used:
- automake 1.9.5
- autoconf 2.59
- libtool  1.5.14

Packaging
=========
A "package" target exists in the Makefile. It will create ooRexx-x.y.tar.gz
containing the same files and directory structure as you would get when
doing a "make install".

By default libtool creates static libraries, which on some platforms are not
stripped and can be HUGE. Distribution of the static libraries is not
required for the base packages, so to ensure that only those files that are
required are distributed you will need to build ooRexx without static
libraries.

To do this (must be done in an empty directory, or after a "make clean":

% ./configure --disable-static
% make

Then the packaging steps...

% make $DESTDIR=`pwd`/tmp install
% make $DESTDIR=`pwd`/tmp package
Creates ./ooRexx-x.y.z-TARGET.tar.gz where TARGET is the canonical platform
name.

Specific platform packaging notes...

RPM - Linux RedHat/Fedora
-------------------------
% make dist
as root:
% cp ooRexx-x.y.z.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
% rpmbuild -ba platform/unix/oorexx.spec

Solaris - PKG
-------------
When building ooRexx for packaging, configure the build as follows:
% ./configure --disable-static --prefix=/opt/sfw

The "make DESTDIR=`pwd`/tmp package" above will also create:
a gzipped ./ooRexx-x.y.z.pkg suitable for Solaris' "pkgadd"

Later versions of g++ build in a dependency between ooRexx and g++
shared libraries; libstdc++.so.x and libgcc_s.so.x.
These shared libraries may be required to be installed on machines that
do not have the version of g++ installed that ooRexx was built with.

The ooRexx package will include these dependencies in the base ooRexx package.
