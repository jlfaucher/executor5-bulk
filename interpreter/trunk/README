                        Open Object Rexx README
			    Version 4.0.0

This is the Rexx Language Association (RexxLA) implementation of Open Object
Rexx (ooRexx). It is derrived from IBM Object REXX product (which was open
sourced under the Common Public License in 2004) but has been enhanced with
new features.

The following components are supported:
* ooRexx base libraries
* The command line utilities rexx, rexxc, rxqueue, rxsubcom and
  rexxhide (Windows only)
* RexxUtil package library
* RxSock package library
* RxMath package Library
* RxRegExp package library
* RxFtp ooRexx class
* ooDialog package library (Windows only)
* ooRexx documentation
* External package developer headers and link libraries

The documentation is packaged in the binary release files but is maintained in
a separate CVS repository module. The CVS module name is oorexx-docs.

Beginning with Version 4.0 of ooRexx, the interpreter, all utilities and
external packages are 64-bit safe. The source can be compiled safely for
execution in a 64-bit operating system environment.

Feedback, as always, is welcome and encouraged.

PREREQUISITES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build the ooRexx package (less the
documentation):

Windows build environment requirements:
---------------------------------------

Building ooRexx on Windows must be done under the Microsoft Visual Studio .Net
environment with the following packages installed.

Microsoft Visual C++ >= 7.0

There are a number of XSL files in the build tree. If you need to modify
those files you will need the following programs:

xalan C              >= 1.9

Unix build environment requirements:
------------------------------------

Building ooRexx on Linux/Unix must be done with the following packages
installed.

gcc       >= 3.4.3 (other compilers are supported in some environments i.e. AIX)
autoconf  >= 2.59
automake  >= 1.9.2
make      >= 3.80
libtool   >= 1.5.6

The following are optional and are only necessary if you have a need for them:

cvs       >= 1.11.17
openssh   >= 3.9p1

There are a number of XSL files in the build tree. If you need to modify
those files you will need the following programs:

xalan C   >= 1.9

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Released Windows ZIP Files
------------------------------

Run the make.bat file:
make.bat

For Released Unix Tarballs
--------------------------

Use standard GNU mechanisms:
./configure && make && make

You can also make make the RPM by the standard GNU mechanism:
./configure && make && make rpm

For Unix CVS Extracts
---------------------

If this is the first time to extract the code run this command:
./bootstrap

This will generate all files needed to compile, then use the instructions
provided for Released Tarballs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make maintainer-clean             (Unix only)
