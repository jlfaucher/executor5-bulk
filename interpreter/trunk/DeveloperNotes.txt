Updating the Version of ooRexx
------------------------------

There are a number of files that need to be updated when the version of Open
Object Rexx changes. Here is the list:

configure.ac
oorexx.ver
shared/windows/verinfo_exe.rc
shared/windows/verinfo_dll.rc



Building ooRexx on Linux/Unix
-----------------------------

ooRexx uses the standard autoconf build mechanism for Linux/Unix. Here are the
steps:

./bootstrap               (only nneded if configure is not present)
./configure
make
make dist                 (only needed if you want create a tar file or an rpm)
make rpm                  (only needed if you want create an rpm)

It is also possible (but NOT recommended) for you to install ooRexx via make.

make install               (NOT recommended!)

Installing ooRexx using "make install" will install ooRexx in such a way that
on most Linux distribution the rexx environment will not be properly set for
execution via any system daemons. This is because the /usr/local/bin subdir is
not in the PATH for daemons on most Linux distributions.



Building ooRexx on Windows
--------------------------

ooRexx requires Microsoft Visual C++ V 7.0 plus service packs. ooRexx uses a
fairly standard Visual C++ build process under Windows. Here are the steps.

make                      (run the make.bat batch file)

This invokes NMAKE with the correct arguments.

Packaging ooRexx requires NSIS 2.0.3 or greater

Be sure to read the contents of the Nmake.inc file. You may want to take
advantage of some of the features you find documented there. This is also
the place to specify a 64-bit Windows build (the default is a 32-bit build)
or a debugging build.
