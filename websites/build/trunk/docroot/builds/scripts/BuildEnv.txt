Naming KVM Images
=================

A KVM image name should take the following form:

    osname-arch-type-number.img

osname - The operating system name. Valid examples are
             fedora13     
	     winxpsp3
	     ubuntu501
arch - The architecture of the operating system. Valid examples are:
	     i386
	     x86_64
type - The type of image. Valid examples are:
	     base - basic clonable image with no additional software installed.
	     orxbuild - base + everything needed to build ooRexx.
number - A numeric number which designate duplicate images. For instance, you
         may want multible ooRexx build images of the same osname, arch and
         type. This gives each image a unique name.

Notes:

1. All parts of the image name should be in LOWER case.

Valid Example Names:

fedora13-i386-base-1.img
winxpsp3-i386-base-1.img
ubuntu501-i386-base-1.img
fedora12-x86_64-orxbuild-2.img
