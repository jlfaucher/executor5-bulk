These are simple socket server and client programs that give an example of
how to send and recieve data using a socket client and server. There are four
programs: sfclient.rex, sfserver.rex, scclient.rex, and scserver.rex
The two programs starting with sf use the socket functions, the two programs
starting with sc use the socket class. The clients and servers are interchangable,
the function based client can be used the the class based server, etc.
