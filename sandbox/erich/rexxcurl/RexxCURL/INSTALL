1. Installation of Rexx/CURL on Unix
====================================
To install Rexx/CURL, unpack the archive (you have probably already done
that), run the configure script supplying the necessary command line 
parameters.  To see what parameters the configure script recognises,
type ./configure --help

Because Rexx/CURL can be configured to run with different Rexx interpreters, 
you must specify the Rexx interpreter you plan on using.
To see the options available, run:

configure --help

If you are interested in building different versions of Rexx/CURL on 
the one platform; like a Regina version and a REXX/imc version
you can do something like this.

To build a version of Rexx/CURL with Regina:

mkdir regina
cd regina
../configure --with-rexx=regina
make

To build a version of Rexx/CURL with REXX/imc:

mkdir rexximc
cd rexximc
../configure --with-rexx=rexximc
make

The configure script looks in some common places for the Rexx libraries 
and header files. These are defined in the configure script. Some of the
common directories are $HOME/include, /usr/local/include for header files
and $HOME/lib and /usr/local/lib for libraries.  There are several others;
see configure for the full list.

If you have installed your Rexx interpreter in a location that the
configure script cannot find, there are two ways in which you can tell
the configure script where to look.
1) Set environment variables:
   This is useful if you only ever build Rexx extensions with the one
   Rexx interpreter and the interpreter is not in one of the common locations.
   REXXINCDIR -> directory where the Rexx interpreter header files are
   REXXLIBDIR -> directory where the Rexx interpreter library files are
2) Specify the directories on the configure command line
   This is useful if you wnat to build with different interpreters.
   and the interpreters are not in one of the common locations.
   --with-rexxincdir=dir -> where dir is the location of the header files
   --with-rexxlibdir=dir -> where dir is the location of the library files

The directory search order is as follows:
- configure command line options
- environment variables
- builtin, common directories

Once you have Rexx/CURL built, it can then be installed.  By default, the
Rexx/CURL executable will be installed into /usr/bin, while the 
dynamically loadable external function package will be installed into 
/usr/lib.  The base path "/usr" can be changed by adding the 
--prefix=path (where path is the base path) to the configure command.
eg. to install Rexx/CURL into /opt/bin and /opt/lib, 
configure --prefix=/opt ...


To install Rexx/CURL, run "make install"

If the platform you are installing Rexx/CURL on does not support dynamically
loadable libraries, you may get some errors during the "make install";
these can be ignored.

Where the platform does support dynamically loadable libraries, you may
need to tell your operating system where these shared libraries are. The
method of doing this varies between operating systems, but generally
involves adding the installed directory to an environment variable such
as LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, etc.


2. Installation of Rexx/CURL on OS/2 and Windows NT/9x/2k
=========================================================
(OS/2 is not supported yet)
Unpack the archive. You've probably already done this.
Copy all executables and DLLs into a directory already in the system
PATH, or to a new directory, but remember to include this directory
in the PATH. On Windows 95/98, you will need to reboot before the
new PATH is effective.
This version of Rexx/CURL is built with SSL support.
Included in the binary distribution are the libcurl 7.10.5 and OpenSSL
0.9.7a DLLs (in "extradlls" directory). If you don't have libcurl
and/or OpenSSL already installed, then you will need to copy these 
DLLs into a directory in your PATH.


3. Testing the installation
===========================
Once you have the Rexx/CURL executables and DLLs (or shared libraries)
installed, run the demo program; testcurl.rexx.

You will need to be able to connect to a machine that is running a web
server to do this.

First run testcurl.rexx with the supplied Rexx/CURL executable to display
the source of a web page. eg to display the source to the Rexx/CURL
home page:
rexxcurl testcurl.rexx http://rexxcurl.sourceforge.net/

Next run testcurl.rexx directly with your Rexx interpreter: (using Regina
as the example):
regina testcurl.rexx http://rexxcurl.sourceforge.net/
