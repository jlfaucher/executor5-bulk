    Since requires directives are resolved when the program file is loaded, the
    tests in this test group will mostly, if not completely, need to be done by
    writing out a program file with the actual test in it.

    Note that this test group itself is depenedent on the requires directive
    working.  If ::requires is completely broken, this test group won't execute.
    But, that should not stop one from writing test cases for the directive.
