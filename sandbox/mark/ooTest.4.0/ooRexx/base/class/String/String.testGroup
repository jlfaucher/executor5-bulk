                                         en/de-coding base64 to test the C-implementation against
                     2007-03-21, ---rgf, added test for SUBCHAR (available with 6.01)
                                         changed sequence of expected/actual values to match the meaning
                                         in the failure message(s)
                     2007-06-10, ---rgf, added test cases for LOWER and UPPER
                     2007-06-23, ---rgf, added test case for 'caselessWordPos'
