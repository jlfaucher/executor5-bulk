                     =================================

Changes since switch_ooDialog420_410-4.2.0.6965
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation:
--------------
  Only minimal progress on the documentation has been made.


Samples added:
--------------

  Minor enhancements were made to many of the samples to both make then
  easier to understand and to better demonstrate the features of ooDialog.


Enhancements:
-------------

  The ApplicationClass class and the .application object were added.  The
  ApplicationClass allows the programmer to set application, or program,
  wide values or defaults.  The .application object is present in every
  ooDialog program and is used to set global values  and defaults for that
  application.

  The global .constDir was added, allowing the use of symbolic IDs for any
  method argument, of any object, where resource IDs are used.  Previously
  the use of symbolic IDs was restricted to methods of a dialog object.

  Good progress on the OwnerDialog implementation was made.  The name of the
  class was changed to TabOwnerDialog to better reflect its actual use.  The
  ManagedTab, TabOwnerDlgInfo, and ControlDlgInfo classes were added as part
  of the TabOwnerDialog implementation.

  The addNewAttribute() and addNewMethod() methods were added to the dialog
  object allowing the dynamic addition of attributes and methods to dialog
  objects.

  The connectKeyEvent() was refactored to make it easier to use.  Both the
  connectKeyEvent() and connectKeyPress() methods were enhanced to return
  the Rexx control object to the event handlers.

  Constant defines were added for all the Windows provided OEM images.

  The setMinTabWidth() method was added to the Tab control class.


Incompatible Changes with Prior Beta Code
-----------------------------------------

  Each of the Menu classes' new() methods have had one argument removed.
  This argument was a cumbersome way of passing in a source to create an
  object level constDir.  The introduction of the global .constDir has
  eliminated the need for any menu object to have a constDir.


Bugs:

  Bugs and inconsistencies found internally, were fixed.

  number of controls that can be assigned a color, or the number of events
  that can be connected to a method in the Rexx dialog, etc..

wizards and the new (to Windows) Aero Wizard.

Property Sheet Page classes:
  PropertySheetPage

values and their symbolic names.  Every virtual key defined by Microsoft is
included in the class.

Documentation
-------------

Much of the ooDialog Method Reference book has been rewritten to correct
errors.  The format of some sections has been changed to make finding the
relevant information easier.  All method tables now give a short
description of the method within the table.

A new book, the ooDialog User Guide, has been added to the ooDialog
distribution.
