                    =================================

ooDialog 4.2.0 is the next major release of ooDialog.  This release will
contain many major enhancements and improvements.  Many things requested
by users have been implemented.  New dialog classes, new dialog control
classes, and new methods to existing classes have been added.  True call
backs from the window message processing loop have been implemented.
Things that were broken have been fixed.  Many areas have been
simplified.  The entire code base has been refactored to use the new
native C++ APIs provided by ooRexx 4.0.0.  The ooDialog reference book
is being rewritten to better explain how to write ooDialog programs.

The ooDialog 4.2.0 beta release, at this time, is not a typical beta.
Rather, the 4.2.0 version is being made available through Switch
ooDialog to provide a way for users of ooDialog to begin testing and
experimenting with the new features in 4.2.0.

Switch ooDialog makes it possible for users to easily and transparently
switch back and forth between the ooDialog 4.2.0 beta and the release
version of ooDialog packaged with ooRexx 4.1.0.  Since Switch ooDialog
is downloadable from SourceForge it is easy and convenient for anyone to
obtain ooDialog 4.2.0.  It is hoped that this will encourage users to
help the project by doing early testing.

The oorexx-users mailing list makes an excellent venue for users to
provide feedback concerning the 4.2.0 version of ooDialog.  All
questions, problems, and concerns related to the ooDialog 4.2.0 can be
posted to the users list and will get a relatively prompt response.
