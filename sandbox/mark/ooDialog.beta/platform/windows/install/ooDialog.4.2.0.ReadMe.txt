                   =================================

ooDialog 4.2.0 is the next major release of ooDialog.  This release will
contain many major enhancements and improvements.  Many things requested
by users have been implemented.  New dialog classes, new dialog control
classes, and new methods to existing classes have been added.  True call
backs from the window message processing loop have been implemented.
Things that were broken have been fixed.  Many areas have been
simplified.  The entire code base has been refactored to use the new
native C++ APIs provided by ooRexx 4.0.0.  The ooDialog reference book
is being rewritten to better explain how to write ooDialog programs.

However, there is still a lot of work to be done before the final
release can be done.

The ooDialog 4.2.0 beta release, at this time, is not a typical beta.
Rather, the 4.2.0 version is being made available through Switch
ooDialog to provide a way for users of ooDialog to contribute some
effort to get the final release finished.

Switch ooDialog makes it possible for users to easily and transparently
switch back and forth between the ooDialog 4.2.0 beta and the release
version of ooDialog packaged with ooRexx 4.1.0.  Since Switch ooDialog
is downloadable from SourceForge it is easy and convenient for anyone to
obtain ooDialog 4.2.0.  It is hoped that this will encourage users to
help with the work of getting 4.2.0 finished up.

What needs to be done that users can help with?
-----------------------------------------------

* The writing of the documentation needs to be finished up.

* The new classes and methods need thorough testing.

* Backwards compatibility testing needs to be done.

* Users that want to shape the evolving ooDialog need to provide input
now, before a release finalizes the new areas.

========================================================================

The implementing C++ source code for 4.2.0 is by and large done.  The
new, and old, code has been well tested.

I often hear users of ooRexx say they would like to help, but they don't
know C or C++.  All of the work listed above that needs to be done to
finish up ooDialog 4.2.0 can be done by any one that has written a
single, simple, ooDialog program.

The bulk of the time consuming work that needs to be done is in the
above of the documentation.  The purpose of releasing this beta is
quite frankly to solicit some help from the user community in finishing
up the docs.

Testing is of course always important, and testing done by people other
than the developers, by users, is likely to find bugs that would not be
found by more developer testing.

Finally, the new class and method names, and the arguments to methods
are not set in stone at this point.  Once a release is down they will
be.  Users can contribute by writing some programs using the new classes
and methods and pointing out awkward naming or argument use, suggesting
ways to make the classes easier to use, or areas of the design that
could be improved.

To contribute to the effort to finish up ooDialog 4.2.0, you will need
to communicate back to the ooDialog developers.  The obvious way to do
this is through the ooRexx project on SourceForge.

In particular the oorexx-users mailing would be an excellent venue to
use to contribute to ooDialog.  All questions related to the ooDialog
4.2.0 should be posted to the users list.  Specific answers as to how to
help with the documentation will be answered on the mailing list.  This
allows the answers to be written only once and gives anyone interested
access to those answers.

Please participate in helping the developers in finishing up ooDialog
4.2.0 by joining in the discussion on the users mailing list.  You can
