                              ===============

Overview
--------

Switch ooDialog is an application that transparently switches between two
versions of ooDialog in an ooRexx installation.  The switch is easy,
extremely fast, and complete.

The first Switch ooDialog package to become available switches between
ooDialog 4.2.0 (now in beta) and ooDialog 4.1.0 (the version of ooDialog
packaged with ooRexx 4.1.0.)

Switch ooDialog is installed using the typical, standard, Windows
installation program.  Once installed, each time the switchOODialog
application is executed, it completely replaces the current installed
version of ooDialog with its opposite version.

The Switch ooDiaog 420 <<-->> 410 package installs ooDialog 4.2.0 during the
inital set up of Switch ooDialog.  The user can then switch back to ooDialog
4.1.0 at any time by executing switchOODialog.exe.  This can be done from
the command line, through a menu item in the Start Menu, or by double
clicking the executable in Explorer.  switchOODialog.exe acts like a toggle,
switching the installed ooDialog between the two versions of ooDialog each
time it is executed.
