                        ooRexxUnit 4.0.0 Snapshot 03
                        ============================

ooRexxUnit is an ooRexx implementation of junit, originally designed and
implemented by Prof. Rony G. Flatscher, and released to the Rexx Language
Association under the Common Public License v1.0 as part of the ooRexx
project.

ooRexxUnit is a testing framework that can be used by anyone to test their
ooRexx programs.  In addition, the ooRexxUnit framework is used by the
ooRexx project team to test the ooRexx interpreter.

ooRexxUnit 4.0.0 Snapshot 03 is a package released by the ooRexx team that
contains both the testing framework and the set of tests used in testing the
ooRexx interpreter at the 4.0.0 level.  As the version name implies, it is a
snapshot of ooRexxUnit at this point in time.  (August 23 2008 svn revision
level: 3060.) This package contains all the currently available test groups
written to test the 4.0.0 interpreter.  These test groups are an excellent
source of techniques for using ooRexxUnit.

The ooRexxUnit framework takes advantage of new features introduced into the
interpreter.  A ooRexxUnit 4.0.0 version of the framework is guaranteed to
work with the 4.0.0 release of the interpreter.  It will not run on a prior
version of ooRexx.  People still running a 3.2.0 version of ooRexx should
get a matching version of the ooRexxUnit framework.

The primary purpose of releasing this snapshot version of ooRexxUnit is to
encourage individuals and organizations to contribute test cases for the
4.0.0 interpreter.

Writing test groups to test the interpreter requires nothing other than an
installed 4.0.0 interpreter and this framework package.  If an individual
has limited knowledge of ooRexx programming, then writing test cases will be
a excellent way to learn the language.

It can not be stressed enough how valuable a contribution to the ooRexx
project test units are.

Individuals wishing to contribute to ooRexx through writing test units can
get advice and help by joining the oorexx-devel list.  The list is free and
open to anyone.  Go to:

  https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=119701

to join the list.

In addition the RexxLA mailing list is also a good place to seek advice or
help in writing test units.  If not already a member of RexxLA, more
information on the group can be found at:

  http://www.rexxla.org/

The test units included in this package serve as examples of using the
framework.
