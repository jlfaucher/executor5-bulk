  usetree.rex show that a treeDirectory is polymorphic with a built-in directory
  treeDirectory.cls is a class that needs to be required. See also
  treeDirectory.testGroup

  Purpose: make some tests for each ooRexx sample pgm distributed.

  Built from a template provided by Rony G. Flatscher 2018-02-25
  Amended based on month.testgroup for more complete testing.

  Where possible the assertions are done both ways to make sure we 
  do not get to much or to little output.
