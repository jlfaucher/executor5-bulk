  interface.rex. define an interface class in ooRexx

  This sample has a built-in error that is visible to the screen
  This test group should be improved.

  Purpose: make some tests for each ooRexx sample pgm distributed.

  Built from a template provided by Rony G. Flatscher 2018-02-25
  Amended based on month.testgroup for more complete testing.

  Where possible the assertions are done both ways to make sure we 
  do not get to much or to little output.
