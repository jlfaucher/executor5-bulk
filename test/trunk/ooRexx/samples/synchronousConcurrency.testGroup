  synchronousConcurrency.rex work queue to synchronize activity between threads

  For this test to work we need to launch the sample program from where
  "Jabberwocky.txt" is located = with the samples.

  The code for this move is not optimized and can be leaner, here q&d

  Purpose: make some tests for each ooRexx sample pgm distributed.

  Built from a template provided by Rony G. Flatscher 2018-02-25
  Amended based on month.testgroup for more complete testing.

  Where possible the assertions are done both ways to make sure we 
  do not get to much or to little output.
