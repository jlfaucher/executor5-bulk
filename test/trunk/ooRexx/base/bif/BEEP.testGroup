  -- Except for Windows and Linux there is generally no frequency and
  -- duration support available.  And even on Linux this will typically
  -- require sudo.  So if we are on BSD or Darwin, or we have no sudo
  -- on Linux, BEEP will fall back to printing a BEL character which
  -- returns almost immediately, not honoring the given duration.

  -- we expect BEEP to take either less than 1 ms (fall-back case) or
  -- around 10 ms (fully supported beep) to complete this request.
  -- we allow up to 35 ms as Windows seems to be rather inaccurate.
