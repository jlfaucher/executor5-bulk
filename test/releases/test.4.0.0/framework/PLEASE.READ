
The documentation and examples for ooRexxUnit.cls are no longer actively
maintained by the ooRexx team.

The examples still execute correctly, but they are somewhat out of date.

The documentation may have some slight inaccuracies, but as a whole should
still be useful in understanding ooRexxUnit.

The framework file itself, ooRexxUnit.cls, *is* actively maintained by the
development team as the ooRexx test suite sits on top of that framework.

Please report any bugs you find in ooRexxUnit.cls.  Contributions from
anyone interested in maintaining the ooRexxUnit documentation and / or
examples are always welcome.
