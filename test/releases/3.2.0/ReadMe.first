                  ooRexxUnit 3.2.0 snapshot 02 Quick Start
                  ========================================

This is the read me file explaining how the ooTest framework is used by
the ooRexx team to test ooRexx.

NOTE: This is mostly a place-holder file, it is just barely started.  But,
the quick start notes below should allow one to quickly run the current
test suite.

The snapshot package includes a quick start tutorial in PDF format.  This
file: ooTestQuick.pdf provides additional useful infomation.

NOTE: You need to match the ooRexxUnit version level with the version of
the ooRexx interpreter you are running.  To use the ooRexxUnit 3.2.0 test
framework you must have the 3.2.0 version of the interpreter running.

Quick Start to execute tests:
=============================

    1.)  Simple command line, running the entire test suite at one time.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

Start in the root directory, the directory that contains this file.  The
Rexx program that runs the tests is: testOORexx.rex

That is the only file you need to use to begin with.  The program file with
no arguments will run the entire ooRexx test suite.  Depending on the horse
power in your system this could take 5 or 6 minutes, maybe longer on a real
old system.

Once you invoke testOORexx everything runs automatically and you will see
the results printed on the screen when the test finishes.

Windows
-------
If you have done a normal install of the interpreter so that file
associations are set up (done automatically by the installer) you can
simply use this command line:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx

of course you can always use the full invocation the interpreter like this:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>rexx testOORexx.rex

Linux
-----
If you have a normal install of the interpreter with the executable in the
path then use this command line:

# ./testOORexx.rex

Look at the file: Expected.Results in the same directory as this file to see
the expected console output when executing the entire test suite.


               2.)  Running just a subset of the test suite.
               ---------------------------------------------

The examples from here on out will be from a Windows box.  The ooTest
framework works the same way on Linux, you just need to translate the
slashes in directory names.

Help
----

This command will print out some help:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx.rex /?
testOORexx version 1.0.0 ooTest Framwork version 1.0.0_3.2.0

usage: testOORexx [OPTIONS]
Try 'testOORexx --help' for more information.

This command will print out the syntax of testOORexx:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx.rex --help

Note that not all command line options are implemented yet.  You will get a
polite message if you use an un-implemented option.

To get started and get a feel for how a test group works, you will probably
want to run just one or two test groups at a time.  The simplest way to do
that is with args to testOORexx.

All test groups are in the subdirectory: ooRexx

This is the default root.  To run a subset of the test you use the -R option
and name a new root.  Browse the ooRexx directory to get an idea of the
directory structure.

All test groups from the root on down are gathered together to be run for
one invocation of testOORexx.  This command line will run only the test
groups in the ooRexx\base\expressions subdirectory.

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx.rex -R ooRexx\base\expressions

There will be 10 test groups executed.

You can execute only one test group by using a combination of the -R option
and the -f option.  The -f option takes a file name part and only executes
test groups that match the file name part.

This command line will run a single test group, the ADDITION.testGroup:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx.rex -R ooRexx\base\expressions -f Addition

and you will get output like this:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx.rex -R ooRexx\base\expressions -f Addition

   3.)  Writing your first test group to contribute to the ooRexx project
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the misc subdirectory there is a template file.  Simply copy it to a
subdirectory that might be appropriate, renaming it to the name of your test
group.  For example:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>copy misc\template.testGroup ooRexx\MyTests.testGroup

Edit the file and start writing your test cases.

PLEASE ask questions on one of the Rexx lists, as this Quick Start does not
go much further.

You can learn a lot by examining some other test groups.

The template.testGroup file will execute as is and contains all the
boilerplate needed.  By simply copying it to a new file name, a working test
group is created:

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>copy misc\template.testGroup ooRexx\MyTests.testGroup
        1 file(s) copied.

E:\ooRexxUnit.3.2.0>testOORexx.rex ooRexx\MyTests.testGroup
