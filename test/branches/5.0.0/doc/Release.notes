                            ooTest  Snapshot 06
                            ===================

ooTest is the framework used by the ooRexx project to test the interpreter
and auxiliary's packaged in the ooRexx distribution.  ooTest sits on top of
the ooRexxUnit framework, which is an ooRexx implementation of junit,
originally designed and implemented by Prof. Rony G. Flatscher, and
released to the Rexx Language Association under the Common Public License
v1.0 as part of the ooRexx project.

ooRexxUnit is a testing framework that can be used by anyone to test their
ooRexx programs.  ooTest is designed specifically for use by ooRexx project
team to test the ooRexx interpreter.

NOTE:
==============================================================================

The information below was written for the ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04 and is no
longer exactly correct.  It is left in this document because reading it will
give you some general information concerning ooTest.

PLEASE read the file "ReadMe.first" in the root directory of this release for
information that is updated for the 06 release.

In particular, there are no pre-built binaries for this release.

==============================================================================


NOTE: The ooTest suite now contains some native API tests that require
external executables to run.  This snapshot has some packages with the
external executables pre-built.  Please pick the package appropriate for
your system and level of expertise.

ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04_windows.x86_64.zip * pre-built binaries Windows 64-bit
ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04_windows.i386.zip   * pre-built binaries Windows 32-bit
ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04_linux.x86_64.tgz   * pre-built binaries Linux 64-bit
ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04_linux.i386.tgz     * pre-built binaries Linux 32-bit

ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04.zip          * source only, Windows file types.
ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04.tgz          * source only, Unix file types.

The packages with the pre-built executables will be easiest to start with.

Note that this release contains a quick start document, ooTestQuick.pdf, in
the doc subdirectory of the ooTest directory tree. This document contains
some tips to help get started in writing test cases.

ooTest Snapshot 04 is a group of related packages released by the ooRexx
team that contains both the testing framework and the set of tests used in
testing the ooRexx interpreter.

This snapshot contains only the 4.0.0 package.  As the name implies, it is a
snapshot of ooTest at this point in time.  (June 17 2009 around a svn
revision level of 4810.) This snapshot contains all the currently available
test groups written to test the 4.0.0 interpreter.  These test groups are
also an excellent source of techniques for using ooRexxUnit.

As the ooRexx interpreter evolves, the ooTest and ooRexxUnit frameworks
evolve to take advantage of new features introduced in the interpreter.  In
addition, there are test cases for testing features that are only present in
the 4.0.0 interpreter.  For these reasons, the ooTest-4.0.0-snapshot04
package is specific to ooRexx version 4.0.0.

With the eminent release of ooRexx 4.0.0, it does not make sense to release
a 3.2.0 snapshot, the 3.2.0 branch has not changed (or has changed very
little) since the last snapshot.

An ooRexxUnit 4.0.0 version of the framework is guaranteed to work with the
4.0.0 release of the interpreter.  It may not run on a prior version of
ooRexx.  A similar thing applies to the 3.2.0 version of ooRexxUnit.  While
it may run under a 4.0.0 interpreter, it may not.  People wishing only to
get the ooRexxUnit framework for their own testing should pick the
ooRexxUnit package designed for the interpreter version they are running /
planning to test on.

The primary purpose of releasing this snapshot version of ooTest is to
encourage individuals and organizations to contribute test cases to test
ooRexx.

Writing test groups to test the interpreter requires nothing other than an
installed ooRexx and this framework package.  If an individual has limited
knowledge of ooRexx programming, then writing test cases will be a excellent
way to learn the language.

It can not be stressed enough how valuable a contribution to the ooRexx
project test units are.

Individuals wishing to contribute to ooRexx through writing test units can
get advice and help by joining the oorexx-devel list.  The list is free and
open to anyone.  Go to:

  https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=119701

to join the list.

In addition the RexxLA mailing list is also a good place to seek advice or
help in writing test units.  If not already a member of RexxLA, more
information on the group can be found at:

  http://www.rexxla.org/

The test units included in this package serve as examples of using the
framework.

-------

Unzip or untar the package in a convenient location.  The root of the
package directory will be as follows, where the x.x.x is replaced by the
version number of the package used:

ooTest.x.x.x
   |
   *------*framework
   |          |
   |          *-----<subdirectories>

             *-----<subdirectories>

The framework directory and subdirectories contain additional documentation
and examples.

The ooRexx directory and subdirectories contain tests implemented using the
ooTest framework, a framework that sits on top of the ooRexxUnit framework.
This directory contains the tests used in testing the ooRexx interpreter.
