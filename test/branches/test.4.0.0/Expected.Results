This file shows the results when running the entire ooRexx 4.0.0 test suite
on a Windows system, at the time of the snapshot release.

Note that this is intended only to give a feel for what the results might
look like.  On a Linux system results will be similar.

The 1 failure listed happened because stdout was redirected into a file to
capture the output.  When run without redirection, the test case would pass.

Please find bugs and report them.  Ideally, open a bug report on SourceForge.
